An environmental friendly or low-carbon-oriented industrial transition not only would largely improve the patterns and magnitude of physical exchanges among societies and their natural environment, but would also be inextricably linked with regional sustainable development policies which can be effective to achieve post-fossil carbon societies. Above all, several institutional innovations and rules, such as industrial symbiosis and low carbon pathway optimization should be considered in scenario analysis and path selection. In this study, a long term analysis focusing on the industrial system in China is presented. Carbon emission decomposition analysis is used to evaluate the potential of low carbon development, promote policies regarding regional sustainable development and construction of eco-industry. Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) decomposition is applied to carbon emissions in the decomposition of time and space sequence. An analysis of the state of the art of climate change science and of the state of industrial symbiosis attempting to create effective industrial development paths reveals that the LMDI Decomposition method can provide crucial orientation for the negotiations towards a sustainable post fossil carbon societies. Three scenarios are designed for the analysis: the Business as Usual (BaU) scenario, the Carbon Reduction (CR) scenario and the Integrated Low Carbon Economy (ILCE) scenario.

An environmental friendly or low-carbon-oriented industrial transition not only would largely improve the patterns and magnitude of physical exchanges among societies and their natural environment, but would also be inextricably linked with regional sustainable development policies which can be effective to achieve post-fossil carbon societies. Above all, several institutional innovations and rules, such as industrial symbiosis and low carbon pathway optimization should be considered in scenario analysis and path selection. In this study, a long term analysis focusing on the industrial system in China is presented. Carbon emission decomposition analysis is used to evaluate the potential of low carbon development, promote policies regarding regional sustainable development and construction of eco-industry. Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) decomposition is applied to carbon emissions in the decomposition of time and space sequence. An analysis of the state of the art of climate change science and of the state of industrial symbiosis attempting to create effective industrial development paths reveals that the LMDI Decomposition method can provide crucial orientation for the negotiations towards a sustainable post fossil carbon societies. Three scenarios are designed for the analysis: the Business as Usual (BaU) scenario, the Carbon Reduction (CR) scenario and the Integrated Low Carbon Economy (ILCE) scenario. Under the assumptions that the share of coal will decline dramatically under the CR and ILCE scenarios from 2009 to 2050 while the share of natural gas and renewable energy will be greatly increased, through the adjustment of energy structure, improvement of energy efficiency and transformation of technical energy merit, energy consumption demand and carbon emission trend in industrial sectors till 2050 in China is simulated, in order to provide the basis for low-carbon industrial transformation in China.

Such integration is facilitated by the advent of eco-industrial parks (EIPs) which use geographic clustering to promote sustainable exchange of materials and energy streams among different plants and companies. In particular, PI methods have been developed for total site integration and successfully implemented in documented industrial cases. However, one aspect of interplant integration is not easily done using classical PI methods, since each potential partner company will participate in a symbiosis scheme specifically with the motivation of increasing its own profits. The self-interest of each partner thus results in conflict of interest which, if not resolved, may result in the failure of the initiative. To address this problem, it is necessary to use an approach based on cooperative game theory which involves pooling the benefits, and then subsequently developing a rational and defensible scheme for sharing the incremental profits among the partners. In this work, we propose the application of a linear programming (LP) cooperative game model to allocate benefits that accrue from interplant integration in an EIP. The approach is first demonstrated using a literature case study, and the results are compared with those determined via alternative cooperative game techniques. Two industrial case studies on interplant integration in palm-based biomass processing complex and sago-based biorefinery (SBB) are then solved to further illustrate the applicability of this technique to problems of more realistic scale.

Such integration is facilitated by the advent of eco-industrial parks (EIPs) which use geographic clustering to promote sustainable exchange of materials and energy streams among different plants and companies. In particular, PI methods have been developed for total site integration and successfully implemented in documented industrial cases. However, one aspect of interplant integration is not easily done using classical PI methods, since each potential partner company will participate in a symbiosis scheme specifically with the motivation of increasing its own profits. The self-interest of each partner thus results in conflict of interest which, if not resolved, may result in the failure of the initiative. To address this problem, it is necessary to use an approach based on cooperative game theory which involves pooling the benefits, and then subsequently developing a rational and defensible scheme for sharing the incremental profits among the partners. In this work, we propose the application of a linear programming (LP) cooperative game model to allocate benefits that accrue from interplant integration in an EIP. The approach is first demonstrated using a literature case study, and the results are compared with those determined via alternative cooperative game techniques. Two industrial case studies on interplant integration in palm-based biomass processing complex and sago-based biorefinery (SBB) are then solved to further illustrate the applicability of this technique to problems of more realistic scale.

Research conducted in 2011 concluded that within third-party brokered resource exchanges between two or more normally unrelated companies, the industrial diversity of a given geographic area was the primary driver behind how far a material travels from its point of origin to its point of reuse. This conclusion was largely derived from intuition and the elimination of other widely discussed drivers or limitations to symbiotic resource movement (e.g., mental distances, resource value and/or the physical characteristics of a resource). The presented article sets out to empirically test this suggestion by mapping the geospatial industrial diversity of England and comparing it to the movement of resources within synergies facilitated by the National Industrial Symbiosis Programme (NISP). Among other results, it was established that there are correlations between geospatial industrial diversity and the distance materials move in addition to the number of synergy types and the replication of synergies facilitated within a given area. It was found that 76% of synergies were facilitated within areas of high (upper 10% of values) contiguous diversity, areas of high 'species' richness possessed a greater variety of synergies, and areas of high synergy replication were areas of high 'species' population evenness. Based on a sensitivity analysis of diversity indices and diversity mapping techniques, it was concluded that high 'species' richness provided the greatest opportunities for realising local industrial symbiosis.

The current study, however, focused on chemical absorption with the following key objectives. First, the paper assessed several reaction pathways that entail the use of combination of common industrial absorbents and oxidants for the absorption of NO.. Second, an analysis on the production of potassium nitrate (KNO3) fertilizer using the byproducts formed from chemical absorption was studied. In addition, a life cycle assessment (LCA) on the environmental implications of NOx absorption and byproducts utilisation for the production of fertiliser through industrial symbiosis was evaluated. This was performed to find the combination of absorbent and oxidant with the least environmental impacts for industrial symbiotic formation. The goal of the LCA was set as the production of 1 kg of potassium nitrate fertiliser.The analysis has shown that use of hydrogen peroxide in combination with calcium hydroxide had the least environmental impacts per kg KNO3 produced. These were a global warming potential (GWP) of 9 kg CO2 equivalent emissions (CO2-e), acidification potential (AP) of -0.073 kg sulphur dioxide equivalent (kg SO2-e), eutrophication potential (EP) of -0.058 kg phosphate equivalent (kg PO4--e), 0.1 kg of solid waste generated, and 15.7 L of water used. The most striking finding was that this combination reduced the overall GWP, AP and EP per kg KNO3 produced by 7.8 kg of CO2-e, 0.12 kg SO2-e and 0.08 kg PO4--e respectively in comparison to the production of conventional KNO3 fertilizer. The hot-spots for all reaction pathways were water and energy use. Water use could not be reduced due to effects on reaction efficiencies for all pathways. However, a solution to reduce the carbon footprint from energy use is the substitution of energy generated from fossils with wind energy. This was evaluated to have the potential of reducing GHG emissions of ozone use by up to 93%, leading to overall GWP reduction of about 86% and 80% for calcium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide use with ozone respectively.

To discover these potential exchanges, this article extends the analysis of local industrial symbiosis to a national scale. A waste input-output table, which is a material flow accounting tool, was compiled and used as a database to examine the existing exchanges of by-products. The supplies and demands of industrial wastes or by-products were compared to highlight their potential use for promoting higher exchange flows. The analysis of the linkages indicated that the majority of each of the by-products were reused by the few industries that had the technology and operational capacity for reuse.

To discover these potential exchanges, this article extends the analysis of local industrial symbiosis to a national scale. A waste input-output table, which is a material flow accounting tool, was compiled and used as a database to examine the existing exchanges of by-products. The supplies and demands of industrial wastes or by-products were compared to highlight their potential use for promoting higher exchange flows. The analysis of the linkages indicated that the majority of each of the by-products were reused by the few industries that had the technology and operational capacity for reuse.

Usually, measuring energy consumption intensity or efficiency applies heat unit which is joule per gross domestic production (GDP) or coal equivalent per GDP. However, this measuring approach is only oriented by the conversion coefficient of heat combustion which does not match the real value of the materials during their formation in the ecological system. This study applied emergy analysis to evaluate the energy consumption intensity to fill this gap. Emergy analysis is considered as a bridge between ecological system and economic system, which can evaluate the contribution of ecological products and services as well as the load placed on environmental systems. In this study, emergy indicator for performing energy consumption intensity of primary energy was proposed. Industrial production is assumed as the main contributor of energy consumption compared to primary and tertiary industries. Therefore, this study validated this method by investigating the two industrial case studies which were Dalian Economic Development Area (DEDA) and Fuzhou economic and technological area (FETA), to comparatively study on their energy consumption intensity between the different kinds of industrial systems and investigate the reasons behind the differences. The results show that primary energy consumption (PEC) of DEDA was much higher than that of FETA during 2006 to 2010 and its primary energy consumption ratio (PECR) to total emergy involvement had a dramatically decline from year 2006 to 2010.

The assessment combines (i) a harmonized techno-economic analysis of conversion pathways expected to be certified for use in commercial aviation by 2020, (ii) a pioneer plant analysis taking into account technological immaturity, and (iii) a quantified assessment of the merits of co-producing RJF alongside existing European supply chains in the pulp, wheat ethanol, and beet sugar industries. None of the pathways assessed are able to reach price parity with petroleum-derived jet fuel in the short term. The pioneer plant analysis suggests that the hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) pathway is currently the best option; the technology achieves the lowest minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) of 29.3 (sic) GJ(-1) (1289 (sic) t(-1)) and the technology is deployed on commercial scale already. In the short term, nth plant analysis shows hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) and pyrolysis emerging as promising alternatives, yielding MFSPs of 21.4 (sic) GJ(-1) (939 (sic) t(-1)) and 30.2 (sic) GJ(-1) (1326 (sic) t(-1)), respectively. The pioneer plant analysis shows considerable MFSP increases for producing drop-in fuels using HTL and pyrolysis as both technologies are relatively immature. Hence, further RD&D efforts into these pathways are recommended. Co-production strategies decrease the MFSP by 4-8% compared to greenfield production. Integration of process units and material and energy flows is expected to lead to further cost reductions. As such, co-production can be a particularly useful strategy to progress emerging technologies to commercial scale.

Under economic, technology, and sustainability consideration, food based 1st generation bioethanol and lignocellulosic-based 2nd generation bioethanol have to exist simultaneously. Therefore, it is necessary to design a hybrid generation bioethanol supply chain (HGBSC) to sustainably meet the ever-increasing energy demand and different government-mandated sustainability standards related to green sustainability such as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, irrigation land and water usage, and energy efficiency. This paper is the first to examine different type of bioethanol plant configurations including industrial symbiosis strategy in order to meet high sustainability standards and design robust and sustainable industrial symbiosis based hybrid generation bioethanol supply chains (ISHGBSC). A novel stochastic mixed integer linear programming (SMILP) model is proposed to design the optimal ISHGBSC under different sustainability standards. A case study of North Dakota (ND) in USA has been studied as an application of the proposed model. The results show that some sustainability standards are stronger than others in terms of the number of green sustainability requirements met. When stronger sustainability standards are applied, the economic performance of the ISHGBSC is sacrificed. The results provide a guideline for policymakers to determine the appropriate standard to use under different sustainable concerns, and for policymakers and investors the best ISHGSBC structure under each standard. In addition, the results provide investors a guideline to invest in different technologies under different sustainability standards.

Through the application of this process sustainable development of the sea salt production in Tianjin could be achieved.\",\"http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su70810078\",\"http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su70810078\"\n\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2015.05.010\",\"NYC WasteMatch - An online facilitated materials exchange as a tool for pollution prevention\",\"Fortuna, Lorena M.; Diyamandoglu, Vasil\",\"RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING\",\"101\",\"\",2015,\"122 131\",\"J\",\"Fortuna, Lorena M.; Diyamandoglu, Vasil\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"NYC WasteMatch - An online facilitated materials exchange as a tool for pollution prevention\",NA,NA,\"\",\"\",NA,NA,NA,\"RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING\",\"\",\"\",NA,\"101\",\"\",\"\",NA,\"122\",\"131\",\"\",\"10.1016/j.resconrec.2015.05.010\",NA,NA,\"AUG 2015\",2015,\"New York City WasteMatch (NYCWM) is an online facilitated materials exchange, funded by the New York City Department of Sanitation and in operation since 1997 that promotes the diversion of reusable materials from the municipal solid waste stream.

The motivation in studying the Porto Marghera industrial park derives from its long and articulated history, its important economic role both at national and European levels, the complexity of the industries involved, the heavy environmental burden, and the high social conflict in the area. The aforementioned factors motivates our interest and indicates reasons for areas' eventual decline. We conclude that since 2004, had, either the endogenous factors or the exogenous ones that influence the European or even global chemical industry, been favorable at the same time, there may have been an opportunity to stem the decline of the area.

Water usage and discharge for each clustered group of industries may be integrated through the introduction of an eco-industrial park (EIP). This paper presents a mathematical programming model for water integration of EIPs to be synthesized with the purpose of mitigating the environmental impact of industrial effluents discharged into watersheds. The model considers the creation of multiple EIPs, their location, sizing, and tasks. To determine the effect of the discharges on the surrounding watershed, a material flow analysis (MFA) model was coupled with water recycle strategies within the industrial facilities and the associated EIPs.

Water usage and discharge for each clustered group of industries may be integrated through the introduction of an eco-industrial park (EIP). This paper presents a mathematical programming model for water integration of EIPs to be synthesized with the purpose of mitigating the environmental impact of industrial effluents discharged into watersheds. The model considers the creation of multiple EIPs, their location, sizing, and tasks. To determine the effect of the discharges on the surrounding watershed, a material flow analysis (MFA) model was coupled with water recycle strategies within the industrial facilities and the associated EIPs.

Biofuels are an example of an industry that needs to be based on a system of rather small-scale local production units due to the limited transportation radius of biomass. Moreover, the benefits of biofuels are greater if their production is based on the integration of local production activities and consumption among traditionally separate industries, as implied by the notion of industrial symbiosis. Such an arrangement, however, requires the establishment of industrial ecosystems that are customised to local conditions, which increases costs and uncertainty for the involved stakeholders and the integrating company. In this paper, we discuss replication strategy as a means of transferring not only technical knowledge, but also the business format to new locations, thereby achieving 'economies of repetition'. The case of a biogas-for traffic solution serves as an illustrative example. We analyse the establishment of a 'vanguard' ecosystem and assess the potential of replicating the solution in six other locations. Based on this, we propose a replication framework that builds on functional modularisation, collaboration mechanisms required for cooperating with the relevant stakeholders, and organisational learning.

However, the climate impact can vary significantly between different production systems and different types of cement products. The market is dominated by ordinary Portland cement, which is based on primary raw materials and commonly associated with combustion of vast amounts of fossil fuels. Therefore, the production of Portland cement can be described as a rather linear process. But there are alternative options, for example, involving large amounts of industrial byproducts and renewable energy which are more cyclic and thus can be characterized as relatively \"\"synergistic\"\".The main purpose of this article is to study how relevant the leading ideas of industrial symbiosis are for the cement industry based on a quantitative comparison of the CO2 emissions from different cement production systems and products, both existing and hypothetical. This has been done by studying a group of three cement plants in Germany, denoted as Cluster West, and the production of cement clinker and three selected cement products. Based on this analysis and literature, it is discussed to what extent industrial symbiosis options can lead to reduced CO2 emissions, for Cluster West and the cement industry in general.Utilizing a simplified LCA model (\"\"cradle to gate\"\"), it was shown that the CO2 emissions from Cluster West declined by 45% over the period 1997-2009, per tonne of average cement. This was mainly due to a large share of blended cement, i.e., incorporation of byproducts from local industries as supplementary cementitious materials. For producers of Portland cement to radically reduce the climate impact it is necessary to engage with new actors and find fruitful cooperation regarding byproducts, renewable energy and waste heat. Such a development is very much in line with the key ideas of industrial ecology and industrial symbiosis, meaning that it appears highly relevant for the cement industry to move further in this direction. From a climate perspective, it is essential that actors influencing the cement market acknowledge the big difference between different types of cement, where an enlarged share of blended cement products (substituting clinker with byproducts such as slag and fly ash) offers a great scope for future reduction of CO2 emissions.

In the effort to reduce CO2 emissions, there is a need for methods to systematically identify, classify and assess different improvement measures, to increase the knowledge about different options and prioritize between them. For this purpose a framework for assessment has been developed, inspired by common approaches within the fields of environmental systems analysis and industrial symbiosis. The aim is to apply a broad systems perspective and through the use of multiple criteria related to technologies and organization strategies facilitate informed decision-making regarding different CO2 performance measures in the cement industry.The integrated assessment framework consists of two parts: a generic and a case-specific part. It is applied to a cement production cluster in Germany called Cluster West, consisting of three cement plants owned by CEMEX. The framework can be used in different ways. It can be used as a tool to perform literature reviews and categorize the state-of-the-art knowledge about options to improve the CO2 performance. It can also be used to assess options for the cement industry in general as well as for individual plants.This paper describes the assessment framework, the ideas behind it, its components and the process of carrying out the assessment. The first part provides a structured overview of the options for improvement for the cement industry in general, while the second part is a case-specific application for Cluster West, providing information about the feasibility for different categories of measures that can reduce the CO2 emissions. The overall impression from the project is that the framework was successfully established and, when applied, facilitated strategic discussions and decision-making. Such frameworks can be utilized to systematically assess hundreds of different measures and identify the ones most feasible and applicable for implementation, within the cement industry but also possibly in other sectors. The results demonstrated that even in a relatively synergistic and efficient production system, like Cluster West, there are opportunities for improvement, especially if options beyond \"\"production efficiency\"\" are considered.

The overall impression from the project is that the framework was successfully established and, when applied, facilitated strategic discussions and decision-making. Such frameworks can be utilized to systematically assess hundreds of different measures and identify the ones most feasible and applicable for implementation, within the cement industry but also possibly in other sectors. The results demonstrated that even in a relatively synergistic and efficient production system, like Cluster West, there are opportunities for improvement, especially if options beyond \"\"production efficiency\"\" are considered.

Previous research on the metabolic processes for the elements that flow through eco-industrial parks has mainly accounted for the flows, stocks, and utilization efficiency of a few elements, but few studies have analyzed the complex internal characteristics of these metabolic processes by combining their structural and functional attributes. In this study, we analyzed the delivery and transformation processes and the internal characteristics of the industrial metabolic processes for sulfur in the Lubei eco-industrial park. By using network analysis, we were able to analyze the structural and functional characteristics of this network from the perspective of nodes (members of the network) and paths (flows between the nodes), and by combining an assessment of the characteristics of the nodes (degree, betweenness, closeness) and the paths (flow quantities and directions), we identified the key node (the cement clinker production), peripheral nodes (the ammonia and power plants), and key paths in the network (from the sulfuric acid plant to the ammonium phosphate plant, from the cement clinker production to the sulfuric acid plant, and from the ammonium phosphate plant to the cement clinker production). These results reveal the advantages and disadvantages of the Lubei eco-industrial park in terms of its structure and function, and suggest ways to improve the efficiency and the sustainable development of the park.

We show resource recovery in the EU to be framed by moral economies, driven by discourses of ecological modernization, environmental justice and resource (in)security, the last of which connects to China's resource-intensive development.\",\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03085147.2015.1013353\",\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03085147.2015.1013353\"\n\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00033790.2015.1007525\",\"Dilemmas of 19th-century Liberalism among German Academic Chemists: Shaping a National Science Policy from Hofmann to Fischer, 1865-1919 Essay in Honour of Alan J.

Our suggestions for future research focus on three aspects: how to quantitatively classify industrial symbiosis systems, monitor the dynamics of a developing industrial symbiosis system, and analyze its internal attributes more deeply.\",\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11707-014-0445-8\",\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11707-014-0445-8\"\n\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es5041442\",\"Techno-Ecological Synergy: A Framework for Sustainable Engineering\",\"Bakshi, Bhavik R.; Ziv, Guy; Lepech, Michael D.\",\"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY\",\"49\",\"3\",2015,\"1752 1760\",\"J\",\"Bakshi, Bhavik R.; Ziv, Guy; Lepech, Michael D.\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"Bakshi, Bhavik/G-3878-2012\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"Techno-Ecological Synergy: A Framework for Sustainable Engineering\",NA,NA,\"\",\"\",NA,NA,NA,\"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY\",\"\",\"\",NA,\"49\",\"3\",\"\",NA,\"1752\",\"1760\",\"\",\"10.1021/es5041442\",NA,NA,\"FEB 3 2015\",2015,\"Even though the importance of ecosystems in sustaining all human activities is well-known, methods for sustainable engineering fail to fully account for this role of nature.

The study was carried out in an industrialised region in the self-governing region of Cantabria (Northern Spain), which comprises 161 inventoried firms, located in 9 different industrial areas. By sectors, 40% work in commerce, the repair of motor vehicles, motorbikes and motorcycles and personal and domestic articles, 16% in metallurgy and the manufacture of metallic products, 13% in construction and the remaining 31% work in such diverse sectors as real estate services, the paper industry, food and the chemical industry, among others. The information on resources and waste flows was collected by means of programmed visits, with a success rate of 104/161 enterprises.

The study was carried out in an industrialised region in the self-governing region of Cantabria (Northern Spain), which comprises 161 inventoried firms, located in 9 different industrial areas. By sectors, 40% work in commerce, the repair of motor vehicles, motorbikes and motorcycles and personal and domestic articles, 16% in metallurgy and the manufacture of metallic products, 13% in construction and the remaining 31% work in such diverse sectors as real estate services, the paper industry, food and the chemical industry, among others. The information on resources and waste flows was collected by means of programmed visits, with a success rate of 104/161 enterprises.

By examining and addressing the main business needs and sustainability challenges, policy makers, developers and other champions, can promote both business value and social value creation. This paper provides valuable lessons from Devens, Massachusetts, an eco-industrial park established in 1993. Based on 29 interviews with local organizations (30% participation rate) the study reports on key business needs and sustainability challenges of local organizations and how Devens Enterprise Commission has worked to address these as part of its vision for Sustainable Devens. The study found that access to infrastructure - such as rail, green buildings and roads - was the most important factor for companies to locate to Devens, followed by the lower cost of real estate (59%) and tax benefits (52%). Top two sustainability challenges for Devens companies included improving energy efficiency and improving materials efficiency. Eighty six percent of Devens organizations reported partnering with others locally, and 79% said their organizations could benefit from such partnerships in the future. Companies were most interested in partnering around joint sourcing, infrastructure and knowledge sharing. The study confirmed that local government efforts to develop Devens infrastructure and establish supportive sustainability policies and programs were in line with business needs and a key factor for Devens' success. It confirmed earlier research on the role of industrial ecology as a cluster development policy and the importance of diversity of firms, trust, sustainability policies, and supporting network development as key to creating both business and social value.

Such integration is facilitated by the advent of EcoIndustrial Parks (EIPs) which uses geographic clustering to promote sustainable exchange of materials and energy streams among different plants and companies.

The approach is demonstrated using a literature case study, and the results are compared with those determined via alternative cooperative game techniques.\",\"http://dx.doi.org/10.3303/CET1545068\",\"http://dx.doi.org/10.3303/CET1545068\"\n\"http://dx.doi.org/10.3303/CET1545225\",\"P-graph for Optimising Industrial Symbiotic Networks\",\"Aviso, Kathleen B.; Chiu, Anthony S.

This design approach suggested an integrated system based primarily on locally available resources and allowed greater insight into the drivers and constraints on local resource use.\",\"http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000366893400088&DestLinkType=FullRecord&DestApp=ALL_WOS\",\"http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000366893400088&DestLinkType=FullRecord&DestApp=ALL_WOS\"\n\"http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000366889700005&DestLinkType=FullRecord&DestApp=ALL_WOS\",\"BiOnto: An Ontology for Biomass and Biorefining Technologies\",\"Trokanas, Nikolaos; Bussemaker, Madeleine; Velliou, Eirini; Tokos, Hella; Cecelja, Franjo\",\"12TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON PROCESS SYSTEMS ENGINEERING (PSE) AND 25TH EUROPEAN SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTER AIDED PROCESS ENGINEERING (ESCAPE), PT B\",\"37\",\"\",2015,\"959 964\",\"S\",\"Trokanas, Nikolaos; Bussemaker, Madeleine; Velliou, Eirini; Tokos, Hella; Cecelja, Franjo\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"Bussemaker, Madeleine/0000-0003-1507-8022\",\"Gernaey, KV; Huusom, JK; Gani, R\",\"\",\"BiOnto: An Ontology for Biomass and Biorefining Technologies\",NA,NA,\"\",\"\",NA,NA,NA,\"12TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON PROCESS SYSTEMS ENGINEERING (PSE) AND 25TH EUROPEAN SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTER AIDED PROCESS ENGINEERING (ESCAPE), PT B\",\"\",\"Computer Aided Chemical Engineering\",NA,\"37\",\"\",\"\",NA,\"959\",\"964\",\"\",\"\",NA,NA,\"2015\",2015,\"This paper presents design and implementation of the BiOnto ontology in the domain of biorefining.

In particular, we are referring to the three dimensions of sustainable development. This approach offers great opportunities for mutually-beneficial cooperation between enterprises, especially for small and medium-sized ones. As part of this concept, together they can make a significant contribution to sustainable development, which they could not make individually. A case study of Germany shows approaches to designing a sustainable industrial area. We also present a new concept of the stability triangle that allows approaching this issue in a consistent manner.\",\"http://dx.doi.org/10.15372/REG20150914\",\"http://dx.doi.org/10.15372/REG20150914\"\n\"http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000361782300018&DestLinkType=FullRecord&DestApp=ALL_WOS\",\"ENVIRONMENT AND RECYCLING: SOME COMMENTS ON THE ENTROPY LIMITS\",\"Marinos-Kouris, Dimitrios; Mourtsiadis, Andreas\",\"FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN\",\"24\",\"3B\",2015,\"1158 1163\",\"J\",\"Marinos-Kouris, Dimitrios; Mourtsiadis, Andreas\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"ENVIRONMENT AND RECYCLING: SOME COMMENTS ON THE ENTROPY LIMITS\",NA,NA,\"\",\"\",NA,NA,NA,\"FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN\",\"\",\"\",NA,\"24\",\"3B\",\"\",NA,\"1158\",\"1163\",\"\",\"\",NA,NA,\"2015\",2015,\"In recent years, the field of environmental management of industrial activities has been causing a great interest among scientists.

In particular, we define a complexity index measuring the economic complexity of the firms involved in an ISN and provide some applications to real case studies.Design/methodology/approach - We define two matrixes, one identifying the waste each firm produces, and the other mapping the wastes each firm uses. Using these matrixes, we compute four indexes: 1) the diversity index of the firm producing wastes exchanged; 2) the diversity index of the firm using the wastes; 3) the ubiquity index of the waste exchanged in terms of number of the firms producing it; and 4) the ubiquity index of the waste exchanged in terms of number of the firms using them.

Complexity of ISNs is a fundamental property of the system, because it allows adaption and emergence useful to improve performance, which thus should be exploited rather than reduced. The approach proposed here allows the firm complexity to be assessed in a simple manner, without requiring high computational efforts like in other methods developed in the literature, but at the same time in a rigorous way, because the main driver of the economic complexity is taken into account.Practical implications - The study provides a rating of firms in a ISN based on the complexity index, which is useful to identify the most critical firms in terms of impact on the network resilience.

Industrial symbiosis (IS) provides a promising approach for increasing the efficiency of energy utilization, with numerous studies reporting the superiority of this technology. However, studies quantifying the energy-saving efficiency of IS remain insufficient. This paper proposes an index system for the quantitative evaluation of the energy-saving efficiency of IS. Both energy-saving and financial indexes were selected, the former include the IS energy-saving index, the contribution rate of energy saved through IS, fractional energy savings, and cut rate of energy consumption per total output value; and the latter include the IS investment payback period, IS input-output ratio, net present value (NPV), and internal rate of return (IRR) of IS. The proposed methods were applied to a case study on the XF Industrial Park (XF IP), in the city of Liaocheng in Shandong Province of China. Three energy-saving channels using IS were found in the XF IP: (a) utilizing the energy of high-temperature materials among industrial processes, (b) recovering waste heat and steam between different processes, and (c) saving energy by sharing infrastructures. The results showed that the energy efficiency index of IS was 0.326, accounting for 34.6 % of the comprehensive energy-saving index in 2011, and the fractional energy-savings were 12.42 %. The index of energy consumption per total industrial output value varied from 90.9 tce/ MRMB to 51.6 tce/MRMB. Thus, the cut rate of energy consumption per total industrial output value was 43.42 %. The average values of the IS input-output ratio was 406.2 RMB/tce, 57.2 % lower than the price of standard coal. Static investment payback period in the XF IP was 8.5 months, indicating that the XF IP began to earn profit 8.5 months after the construction of all IS modes. The NVP and IRR of each IS mode in the XF IP were greater than zero, with average values equal to 1,789.96 MRMB and 140.96 %, respectively.

Although several studies indicate that upstream processes contribute significantly to the total environmental impact of the system, few studies assess how environmental strategy development can be approached from a life cycle perspective. The aim of this paper was to investigate the practical significance of life cycle-based environmental strategy development using a chemical industry cluster in Sweden as the case study. To assess the environmental impact, a cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment (LCA) was chosen as the method, with the total annual production of the cluster in 2011 as the functional unit. To cover the whole value chain, the global warming potential for downstream processes was also estimated. The findings were linked to the cluster vision, which aims to reduce environmental impact by 2030. The results indicate that the cluster must focus on the whole value chain when pursuing the aim of producing sustainable products as environmental impact both upstream and downstream of the cluster accounts for a larger share than on-site processes. The assessment also enables distribution of environmental impact among incoming material streams, thus providing the cluster with decision support when introducing renewable and recycled materials. Additionally, the assessment supports strategy comparison and serves as a base case against which strategy opportunities can be evaluated. This study demonstrates that the life cycle approach has interesting potential to support industry cluster companies in their mutual effort to improve environmental performance.

The developed model consists of two main modules; namely, a power generation dispatching module for the Japanese electricity grid and a demand-side energy flow module based on a sectorial energy balance table.

Industrial and power plant-sourced waste heat is a significant potential resource for nearby sinks. However, because industrial facilities are not usually optimally located for waste heat utilization, most of the potential heat is emitted to the surrounding environment. To achieve the future targets of the efficient energy provision network system in the coastal regions of Fukushima that experienced tsunami devastation, this study developed a simulation process model integrating spatial analysis, technology systems, and land use controls to maximize the utilization of waste heat from coal-fired thermal power plants to nearby plant factories. Shinchi-town in Fukushima Prefecture was selected as a case study, in which an energy symbiosis network was being constructed. Our findings indicated that the waste heat system provided more environmental benefits than the individual boiler system. With waste heat utilization, fuel oil consumption is reduced by 16.05 Tliyear, while total CO2 emissions are reduced by 1204 ton/year. In addition, as economic feasibility depends on the distance between the power plant and the factory, cost-effective areas with regards to heat supply were identified based on cost-benefit analysis and geographic information system techniques.

Industrial and power plant-sourced waste heat is a significant potential resource for nearby sinks. However, because industrial facilities are not usually optimally located for waste heat utilization, most of the potential heat is emitted to the surrounding environment. To achieve the future targets of the efficient energy provision network system in the coastal regions of Fukushima that experienced tsunami devastation, this study developed a simulation process model integrating spatial analysis, technology systems, and land use controls to maximize the utilization of waste heat from coal-fired thermal power plants to nearby plant factories. Shinchi-town in Fukushima Prefecture was selected as a case study, in which an energy symbiosis network was being constructed. Our findings indicated that the waste heat system provided more environmental benefits than the individual boiler system. With waste heat utilization, fuel oil consumption is reduced by 16.05 Tliyear, while total CO2 emissions are reduced by 1204 ton/year. In addition, as economic feasibility depends on the distance between the power plant and the factory, cost-effective areas with regards to heat supply were identified based on cost-benefit analysis and geographic information system techniques. Finally, policy implications to support the construction of an energy symbiosis network are proposed and discussed. Such a resolution with energy symbiosis and waste heat utilization would shed light on the Japanese energy dilemma. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

It is critical to conduct a scientific assessment so that appropriate solutions can be found by considering the local realities. Many evaluation methods, such as emergy analysis, material flow analysis, data envelopment analysis and ecological footprint analysis, have been proposed. Among them, ecological footprint analysis has been applied as a useful policy and planning tool for evaluating urban sustainability. The aim of this paper is to evaluate two industrial cities by using ecological footprint method in Shenyang, China and Kawasaki, Japan. The two cities have been \"\"friendship cities\"\" for over 30 years and have similar industrial structures. In order to present a holistic evolution picture on their ecological footprints, we collected all the relevant data for the period of 1997-2009. The results show that Shenyang's ecological footprints experienced a significant increase, while such figures in Kawasaki were quite stable, but per capita figures in Shenyang were much less than those in Kawasaki, indicating that a gap between the two cities still exist. In order to further improve its sustainable development, Shenyang should closely collaborate with Kawasaki, learning Kawasaki's eco-town experiences and other environmental management experiences. In addition, Shenyang should also learn from other leading cities and try to optimize its industrial and energy structure and improve their citizens' environmental awareness so that it can move toward a more sustainable development direction.

A feed-forward back propagation neural network model was developed and trained using existing plant data (5months), to predict temperature, pressure, and mass flow rate of steam, using the following input parameters: feed water pressure, feed water temperature, conveyor speed, and incinerator exit temperature. The predictive capability of the model was evaluated in terms of mean absolute percentage error between the model fitted and actual plant data, while sensitivity analysis was performed on the input parameters by determining the absolute average sensitivity values.

Finally, an industrial ecosystem at Kalundborg was adopted as a case study to illustrate the effectiveness and convenience of the proposed methodology.\",\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0099634\",\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0099634\"\n\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/gps-2013-0102\",\"Novel sustainable industrial processes: from idea to commercial scale implementation\",\"Harmsen, Jan\",\"GREEN PROCESSING AND SYNTHESIS\",\"3\",\"3\",2014,\"189 193\",\"J\",\"Harmsen, Jan\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"Novel sustainable industrial processes: from idea to commercial scale implementation\",NA,NA,\"\",\"\",NA,NA,NA,\"GREEN PROCESSING AND SYNTHESIS\",\"\",\"\",NA,\"3\",\"3\",\"\",NA,\"189\",\"193\",\"\",\"10.1515/gps-2013-0102\",NA,NA,\"JUN 2014\",2014,\"This article summarizes the consensus on sustainable development, shows industrial cases and provides key guidelines to transfer ideas into commercial scale processes.

We elucidate its embedding in industrial ecology (IE), trace the development of research themes, and reveal the evolution of the research network through analysis of the core literature and journals that appeared from 1997 to 2012 by citation analysis, cocitation analysis, and network analysis.In the first period (1997-2005), IS research held a minority share in the IE literature. The research revolved around the concept of IS, the assessment of eco-industrial park projects, and the establishment of waste treatment and recycling networks. In the second period (2006-2012), diverse research approaches and theories enriched the field, which has led to a maturation in theory building.

We elucidate its embedding in industrial ecology (IE), trace the development of research themes, and reveal the evolution of the research network through analysis of the core literature and journals that appeared from 1997 to 2012 by citation analysis, cocitation analysis, and network analysis.In the first period (1997-2005), IS research held a minority share in the IE literature. The research revolved around the concept of IS, the assessment of eco-industrial park projects, and the establishment of waste treatment and recycling networks. In the second period (2006-2012), diverse research approaches and theories enriched the field, which has led to a maturation in theory building.

The Beijing Economic Technological Development Area (BDA), a typical national eco-industrial park of China, was chosen for a case study. The results show that the total greenhouse gas emissions of the eco-industrial park were 3.16 Mt CO(2)e in 2010, and energy-related greenhouse gas emissions accounted for 97% of the total. The greenhouse gas emissions increased by 94% from 2005 to 2010. However, the greenhouse gas emissions intensity decreased by 20%, mainly due to optimization of the energy structure and improvements in energy efficiency. The share of non-industrial sectors in the total greenhouse gas emissions increased from 12% to 33%, and the construction industry became the second biggest emissions source, after manufacturing.

Drawing on the literature of IS and complex networks, this paper proposes three forming processes of IS networks corresponding to different institutional settings preferential growth under self-organization, homogeneous growth under coordination and facilitation, and random pairing under planning and policy promotion. We examine the growth of IS networks and the impact of promotional institutions by analyzing a diverse sample of 15 IS networks including 204 firms. Additional illustrations of by-product and utility networks are provided for the cases of Kalundborg (Denmark) and Kwinana (Australia). The results suggest that preferential growth is a dominant process widely held in self-organized IS networks, indicating an enduring disparity of firms' capabilities in building IS. Firm-organized coordination as well as government facilitation and promotion tend to change the preferential growth to a more homogeneous one, by improving the capabilities of previously disadvantaged firms. The improvement of disadvantaged firms and non-preferential growth under facilitation and promotion call for the overall symbiotic opportunities to be explored more thoroughly, and render the IS system more resilient in a region. This effect of policy promotion, however, may take time to change the IS system, and may be diminished in utility exchanges and in areas with fewer, undiversified firms, due to technical difficulties and lack of opportunities to expand an existing IS network. Policy-making and planning should take into consideration the local industry composition and context, as well as other cost associated with the policies to determine the appropriate extent of promotion and incentives.

Intra and inter-plant heat exchange for the process streams is allowed. For a proper reuse of the waste heat at low temperature, a set of organic Rankine cycles (ORCs) can be integrated inside the eco-industrial park. This way, the proposed superstructure allows proper heat integration to reduce the use of external cooling and heating utilities as well as the consumption of external electric energy. The proposed superstructure is modeled through a mathematical programming formulation where the objective function considers the simultaneous minimization of the operating and capital costs for the units involved in the system as well the possible revenues from the sales of electricity. The model is formulated in such a way that avoids numerical complications during its solution. Results from the application of the proposed approach show that the interplant-integration offers significant savings compared to the traditional single-plant integration with and without considering ORCs.

Intra and inter-plant heat exchange for the process streams is allowed. For a proper reuse of the waste heat at low temperature, a set of organic Rankine cycles (ORCs) can be integrated inside the eco-industrial park. This way, the proposed superstructure allows proper heat integration to reduce the use of external cooling and heating utilities as well as the consumption of external electric energy. The proposed superstructure is modeled through a mathematical programming formulation where the objective function considers the simultaneous minimization of the operating and capital costs for the units involved in the system as well the possible revenues from the sales of electricity. The model is formulated in such a way that avoids numerical complications during its solution. Results from the application of the proposed approach show that the interplant-integration offers significant savings compared to the traditional single-plant integration with and without considering ORCs.

For a given expansion plan in an industrial city layout the formulated optimisation model determines the optimum amount of water to be utilized in different time periods with an objective of minimizing total cost of piping and freshwater. Results for both multi-period planning and individual period planning have been developed and compared.

Most studies focus on energy consumption emission reduction and energy efficiency improvement. Material saving is also important for carbon emission reduction from a lifecycle perspective. IS (Industrial symbiosis) and UrS (urban symbiosis) have been effective since both of them encourage byproduct exchange. However, quantitative carbon emission reduction evaluation on applying them is still lacking. Consequently, the purpose of this paper is to fill such a gap through a case study in Kawasaki Eco-town, Japan. A hybrid LCA model was employed to evaluate to the lifecycle carbon footprint. The results show that lifecycle carbon footprints with and without IS and UrS were 26.66 Mt CO(2)e and 30.92 Mt CO(2)e, respectively. The carbon emission efficiency was improved by 13.77% with the implementation of IS and UrS.

The quantification of the scale and significance of IS benefits is valuable for IS promotion, while there is much few attention to it, especially in China. Under this circumstance, this paper evaluates and compares the number, scale and the related environmental/economic gains of IS activities in iron/steel-centered industrial areas in Liuzhou and Jinan in China, and Kawasaki in Japan. Results show that: in Liuzhou, there are three symbiosis activities between industries. The annual by-product/waste exchange is more than 2 million ton/y, gaining economic revenue more than 36.55 million USD for the iron/steel company. In Jinan, seven symbiotic links are between industries, and two are between urban community and iron/steel plant. The total by-product/waste exchange is over 8 million ton/y and the economic gains account to 158 million USD. In Kawasaki, iron/steel industry relates to four symbiotic links, the total by-product/waste exchange amount is about 500 kton/y, with the economic gains over 54 million USD. The form and the complexity of the IS network are different in the three cases. IS in Liuzhou and Jinan are with the features of large number and scale, but single types. While in Kawasaki, IS includes not only traditional exchanges between iron/steel plant and the other industries, but also the innovative utilization of urban refuse by industrial area. Finally, from the perspective of technology, legislative framework and support policy, circular technology inventory, integrated waste management system, information platform and national subsidies are needed to support the ever-improvement of IS promotion in China's iron/steel industry.

This new approach is focussed on saving energy and raw materials and reducing the environmental impact associated with the waste collection system in urban areas, as well as allowing the design and planning of the best available technologies and most environment-friendly management. The methodology considers a large variety of variables from the point of view of sustainable urban transport such as the location and size of the urban area, the amount of solid waste generated, the level of social awareness on waste separation procedures, the distance between houses and waste collection points and the distance from the latter to the possible recovery plants and/or landfills, taking into account the material and energy recovery ratio within an integrated waste management system. As a case study, two different waste collection systems have been evaluated with this methodology in the ecocity Valdespartera located in Zaragoza, Spain, consisting of approximately 10,000 homes: (i) a system based on traditional truck transportation and manual collection, and (ii) a stationary vacuum waste collection system. Results show that, when operating at loads close to 100%, the stationary collection system has the best environmental performance in comparison with the conventional system. In contrast, when operating at load factors around 13% the environmental benefits in terms of net CO2-eq. emissions for the stationary collection system are around 60% lower in comparison with the conventional one.\",NA,NA,\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",1,0,0,1,0,1,NA,NA,\"\",\"1879-1026\",\"\",\"MEDLINE:23792249\",23792249,NA,\"Environmental-benefit analysis of two urban waste collection systems.

The methodology considers a large variety of variables from the point of view of sustainable urban transport such as the location and size of the urban area, the amount of solid waste generated, the level of social awareness on waste separation procedures, the distance between houses and waste collection points and the distance from the latter to the possible recovery plants and/or landfills, taking into account the material and energy recovery ratio within an integrated waste management system. As a case study, two different waste collection systems have been evaluated with this methodology in the ecocity Valdespartera located in Zaragoza, Spain, consisting of approximately 10,000 homes: (i) a system based on traditional truck transportation and manual collection, and (ii) a stationary vacuum waste collection system. Results show that, when operating at loads close to 100%, the stationary collection system has the best environmental performance in comparison with the conventional system. In contrast, when operating at load factors around 13% the environmental benefits in terms of net CO2-eq. emissions for the stationary collection system are around 60% lower in comparison with the conventional one.\",\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.05.053\",\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.05.053\"\n\"http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su5104329\",\"Toward a Smart Sustainable Development of Port Cities/Areas: The Role of the \"\"Historic Urban Landscape\"\" Approach\",\"Girard, Luigi Fusco\",\"SUSTAINABILITY\",\"5\",\"10\",2013,\"4329 4348\",\"J\",\"Girard, Luigi Fusco\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"Toward a Smart Sustainable Development of Port Cities/Areas: The Role of the \"\"Historic Urban Landscape\"\" Approach\",NA,NA,\"\",\"\",NA,NA,NA,\"SUSTAINABILITY\",\"\",\"\",NA,\"5\",\"10\",\"\",NA,\"4329\",\"4348\",\"\",\"10.3390/su5104329\",NA,NA,\"OCT 2013\",2013,\"After the 2008 crisis, smart sustainable development of port areas/cities should be developed on the basis of specific principles: the synergy principle (between different actors/systems, in particular the socio-cultural and economic system), the creativity principle and the circularization principle.

So far, there has been little systematic research into the process through which firms and other relevant actors build up collaborations for IS. I present Event Sequence Analysis as a research approach that allows for a systematic, longitudinal analysis of process phenomena and I outline the steps to be taken in the application of the approach. I demonstrate the value of the approach by offering a first analysis of how companies in the Canal Zone of Zeeland in the Netherlands build up the institutional capacity that enables them to address the development of IS collaboratively. The analysis reveals that institutional capacity did not build up in a linear way. The generation of institutional capacity enabled the involved actors to engage in increasingly complex by-product synergies and utility synergies. It also enabled the actors to develop a strategic vision in which they articulated the development of a bio based industrial cluster as a common purpose. This common purpose stimulated the actors to shift their focus from the development of individual synergies to the development of a regional network of such synergies. Event Sequence Analysis proves to be a promising approach to investigating phenomena such as institutional capacity building and the emergence and development of Industrial Symbiosis.

I present Event Sequence Analysis as a research approach that allows for a systematic, longitudinal analysis of process phenomena and I outline the steps to be taken in the application of the approach. I demonstrate the value of the approach by offering a first analysis of how companies in the Canal Zone of Zeeland in the Netherlands build up the institutional capacity that enables them to address the development of IS collaboratively. The analysis reveals that institutional capacity did not build up in a linear way. The generation of institutional capacity enabled the involved actors to engage in increasingly complex by-product synergies and utility synergies. It also enabled the actors to develop a strategic vision in which they articulated the development of a bio based industrial cluster as a common purpose. This common purpose stimulated the actors to shift their focus from the development of individual synergies to the development of a regional network of such synergies. Event Sequence Analysis proves to be a promising approach to investigating phenomena such as institutional capacity building and the emergence and development of Industrial Symbiosis.

The results reveal the operational problems created by the structure of the industrial networks and provide a basis for improving the degree of completeness, thereby increasing their potential for sustainable development and enriching the methods available for the study of industrial symbiosis.\",\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11707-012-0349-4\",\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11707-012-0349-4\"\n\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.1120\",\"VARIATIONS IN ECOSYSTEM SERVICE VALUES AND LOCAL ECONOMY IN RESPONSE TO LAND USE: A CASE STUDY OF WU'AN, CHINA\",\"Zhang, J.

What is more, functionally innovative symbiosis products have the potential to promote residue utilisation and recovery and to prevent or reduce waste generation in line with the EU level 'recycling society' concept. However, successful product development requires an enabling institutionally aligned environmental approach that includes appropriate market incentives and regulatory instruments. This paper aims to identify the possible institutional barriers in the EU legal framework that have to be addressed to promote the development of such primary residue based process industry symbiosis products, with thorough consideration of full product life-cycles. Recommendations for overcoming these barriers and on the design of new approaches that support industrial symbiosis and contribute to progress towards sustainable societies are also outlined. These include enhanced focus on creating an enabling institutional environment for industrial innovations and the promotion of material efficiency through incentives policies and regulations, as well as soft law guidance on novel uses of materials and closure of resource cycles. Making a wider system more sustainable on an eco-efficiency basis also calls the definition of system boundaries into question. Applying a systemic approach, such as that offered by both IE and IS, which cover sustainability and recycling to achieve more resource efficient systems, appears to offer a way forward.

Under the ESER program, Chinese manufacturers have struggled to reduce their environmental pollution and energy consumption. To achieve their ESER goals, Chinese manufacturers should cooperate with their suppliers and customers. However, it is not clear how to drive Chinese manufacturers to implement extended supply chain (ESC) practices for ESER goals, and what kinds of barriers exist. By utilizing a total of 299 usable questionnaires, we did descriptive analysis. Statistic results show that Chinese manufacturers implement ESC practices for ESER goals at a low level. Coercive, normative and mimetic drivers are generally weak while internal barriers are relatively higher. We further used hierarchical analysis to examine whether drivers motivate Chinese manufacturers to implement ESC practices for ESER goals, and whether barriers impede ESC practices. Main regression results and implications include: (1) Coercive drivers do not really motivate ESC practices for ESER goals. To promote ESC practices for the ESER goals, the Chinese government should enact stricter regulations and strengthen their enforcement level. (2) Normative drivers motivate Chinese manufacturers to implement sustainable purchasing. With the increasing environmental awareness of Chinese consumers, Chinese manufactures will have higher normative drivers and then be more proactive to implement sustainable purchasing. (3) Mimetic drivers promote both sustainable purchasing and sustainable customer cooperation. By learning from manufacturers in developed countries, especially those operating in China, Chinese manufacturers tend to implement ESC practice for ESER goals.

(4) Internal barriers, such as lack of financial gains, resource and capability, are main obstacles for the implementation of sustainable customer cooperation. Thus, how to overcome internal barriers is a key for Chinese manufacturers to effectively and efficiently implement ESC practices for ESER goals. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to continue to improve the environmental performance of PV manufacturing using proposed industrial symbiosis techniques, this paper performs a life cycle analysis (LCA) on both conventional 1-GW scaled a-Si:H-based single junction and a-Si:H/microcrystalline-Si:H tandem cell solar PV manufacturing plants and such plants coupled to silane recycling plants. Both the energy consumed and greenhouse gas emissions are tracked in the LCA, then silane gas is reused in the manufacturing process rather than standard waste combustion. Using a recycling process that results in a silane loss of only 17% instead of conventional processing that loses 85% silane, results in an energy savings of 81,700 GJ and prevents 4400 tons of CO2 from being released into the atmosphere per year for the single junction plant. Due to the increased use of silane for the relatively thick microcrystalline-Si:H layers in the tandem junction plants, the savings are even more substantial - 290,000 GJ of energy savings and 15.6 million kg of CO2 eq. emission reductions per year. This recycling process reduces the cost of raw silane by 68%, or approximately $22.6 million per year for a 1-GW a-Si:H-based PV production facility and over $79 million per year for tandem manufacturing.

By conducting a comparative analysis of international assessment tools for neighborhoods to derive sustainability characteristics and principles behind specific indicators, we suggest implications for the development of a sustainability assessment tool for residential neighborhoods in the Korean context.\",\"http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=KJD:ART001740780&DestLinkType=FullRecord&DestApp=ALL_WOS\",\"http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=KJD:ART001740780&DestLinkType=FullRecord&DestApp=ALL_WOS\"\n\"http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000347398400058&DestLinkType=FullRecord&DestApp=ALL_WOS\",\"Eco-city Planning: Pure Hype or Achievable Concept\",\"Yuen, Belinda\",\"PROCEEDINGS OF THE 49TH ISOCARP CONGRESS: FRONTIERS OF PLANNING - EVOLVING AND DECLINING MODELS OF PLANNING PRACTICE\",\"\",\"\",2013,\"729 739\",\"J\",\"Yuen, Belinda\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"Featherstone, J\",\"\",\"Eco-city Planning: Pure Hype or Achievable Concept\",NA,NA,\"\",\"\",NA,NA,NA,\"PROCEEDINGS OF THE 49TH ISOCARP CONGRESS: FRONTIERS OF PLANNING - EVOLVING AND DECLINING MODELS OF PLANNING PRACTICE\",\"\",\"\",NA,\"\",\"\",\"\",NA,\"729\",\"739\",\"\",\"\",NA,NA,\"2013\",2013,\"This paper seeks to investigate the case city of Singapore.

We develop two multi-regression models using questionnaire survey data from recycling facilities and cross-sectional data from 23 Eco-Towns to analyze the amount of waste treated by and the operating rate of recycling facilities. Dependent variables are introduced through a review of the literature on industrial symbiosis and the situation of Japanese Eco-Towns, focusing on three necessary features: recycling boundaries, government policy intervention, and local collaboration and partnership. The results of two simple regression models of recycling facilities in Eco-Towns offer several fruitful insights that aid in understanding the performance of recycling projects. First, recycling facilities' geographical proximity to users of recycled products can contribute to high operating rates. Second, subsidies for constructing facilities do not improve recycling projects' operating rates.

Through field study and interviews in Suzhou Industrial Park (SIP), in Jiangsu Province, we conducted an energy-based GHG emissions inventory for SIP area from 2005-2010, with forecasts to 2015. The area emitted a total of 10.30 MMT CO2E in 2010. Three development strategies including business-as-usual (BAU), existing and pending regulations (EPR) and voluntary mitigating efforts (VME) were introduced to estimate the energy-related GHG emissions in 2015.

The critical factors for the development of chemical industrial parks in China are discussed and the outlook for the path forward is presented. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Large-scale projects tended to locate closer to the users of recycled products than did small-scale projects. For treating similar types of waste, projects producing recycled products for special users (e.g., feedstock to a blast furnace for iron production) tended to locate closer to the users than those not producing for special users. The type of waste had a strong effect on the savings of virgin materials and recycling boundaries, while local factors had significant impacts on operational performance. The results also showed that agglomeration did not significantly contribute to the environmental benefits or operational performance of eco-town projects. Another finding was that national agencies were helpful for facilitating cross-prefecture transportation and long-distance transaction of wastes. Implications of the findings are also discussed.\",\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1530-9290.2011.00422.x\",\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1530-9290.2011.00422.x\"\n\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1530-9290.2011.00442.x\",\"Green City\",\"Ferrer, Geraldo; Cortezia, Sandro; Neumann, Jaqueline Morbach\",\"JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY\",\"16\",\"1\",2012,\"142 152\",\"J\",\"Ferrer, Geraldo; Cortezia, Sandro; Neumann, Jaqueline Morbach\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"Green City\",NA,NA,\"\",\"\",NA,NA,NA,\"JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY\",\"\",\"\",NA,\"16\",\"1\",\"\",NA,\"142\",\"152\",\"\",\"10.1111/j.1530-9290.2011.00442.x\",NA,NA,\"FEB 2012\",2012,\"This research analyzes the Green City project in the town of Tres Coroas, Brazil.

Although this investigation is primarily theoretical, the analysis of those games shows that, by playing them, individuals can effectively learn about sustainable development and environmental issues.\",\"http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000321562800004&DestLinkType=FullRecord&DestApp=ALL_WOS\",\"http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000321562800004&DestLinkType=FullRecord&DestApp=ALL_WOS\"\n\"http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000320589000093&DestLinkType=FullRecord&DestApp=ALL_WOS\",\"Introduction to ZeroWIN\",\"Kopacek, Bernd; Schadlbauer, Sabine\",\"2012 ELECTRONICS GOES GREEN 2012+ (EGG)\",\"\",\"\",2012,\"NA NA\",\"B\",\"Kopacek, Bernd; Schadlbauer, Sabine\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"Lang, KD; Nissen, NF; Middendorf, A; Chancerel, P\",\"\",\"Introduction to ZeroWIN\",NA,NA,\"\",\"\",NA,NA,NA,\"2012 ELECTRONICS GOES GREEN 2012+ (EGG)\",\"\",\"\",NA,\"\",\"\",\"\",NA,NA,NA,\"\",\"\",NA,NA,\"2012\",2012,\"The \"\"ZeroWIN - Towards Zero Waste in Industrial Networks\"\" project develops innovative approaches and effective strategies for the prevention of waste in industry.

Results indicate that the retrofit of various single-plant water networks into an eco-industrial park yields additional economic and environmental benefits than the stand-alone network retrofit.\",\"http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000316669100007&DestLinkType=FullRecord&DestApp=ALL_WOS\",\"http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000316669100007&DestLinkType=FullRecord&DestApp=ALL_WOS\"\n\"http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000316669100034&DestLinkType=FullRecord&DestApp=ALL_WOS\",\"Semantic Formalism for Waste and Processing Technology Classifications Using Ontology Models\",\"Trokanas, Nikolaos; Raafat, Tara; Cecelja, Franjo; Kokossis, Antonis; Yang, Aidong\",\"22 EUROPEAN SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTER AIDED PROCESS ENGINEERING\",\"30\",\"\",2012,\"167 171\",\"S\",\"Trokanas, Nikolaos; Raafat, Tara; Cecelja, Franjo; Kokossis, Antonis; Yang, Aidong\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"Cecelja, Franjo/0000-0002-4683-4313\",\"Bogle, IDL; Fairweather, M\",\"\",\"Semantic Formalism for Waste and Processing Technology Classifications Using Ontology Models\",NA,NA,\"\",\"\",NA,NA,NA,\"22 EUROPEAN SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTER AIDED PROCESS ENGINEERING\",\"\",\"Computer-Aided Chemical Engineering\",NA,\"30\",\"\",\"\",NA,\"167\",\"171\",\"\",\"\",NA,NA,\"2012\",2012,\"Ontologies and semantics are widely used in many areas in an effort to enable the sharing, reusability and interoperability of knowledge.

The result shows that the indexes can be used to quantify the interrelationship between the development project and the environment and that the required regulatory measures for land development can be implemented via master plans.\",\"http://dx.doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.178-181.808\",\"http://dx.doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.178-181.808\"\n\"http://dx.doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.178-181.825\",\"Research on construction of National Eco-Industrial Demonstration Park of China\",\"Bai, Xue; Chu, Chunli; Ju, Meiting\",\"SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORTATION, PTS 1-4\",\"178-181\",\"\",2012,\"825 828\",\"S\",\"Bai, Xue; Chu, Chunli; Ju, Meiting\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"Chu, MJ; Xu, HH; Jia, Z; Fan, Y; Xu, JP\",\"\",\"Research on construction of National Eco-Industrial Demonstration Park of China\",NA,NA,\"\",\"\",NA,NA,NA,\"SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENT AND TRANSPORTATION, PTS 1-4\",\"\",\"Applied Mechanics and Materials\",NA,\"178-181\",\"\",\"\",NA,\"825\",\"828\",\"\",\"10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.178-181.825\",NA,NA,\"2012\",2012,\"Eco-industrial Park has become an important form to carry out the concept of circular economy and to establish ecological civilization.

The quick growth of the wind power generation industry has promoted the development of the Chinese wind turbine manufacturing industry. Similarly, the quantity and the productivity of the local Chinese Wind Turbine Manufacturers (WTMs) have also undergone a quick and significant expansion. This is resulting in an increase in competition amongst the WTMs in China. Being relatively new, this creates a fertile environment for local Chinese WTMs that is ripe for study and analysis.

The quick growth of the wind power generation industry has promoted the development of the Chinese wind turbine manufacturing industry. Similarly, the quantity and the productivity of the local Chinese Wind Turbine Manufacturers (WTMs) have also undergone a quick and significant expansion. This is resulting in an increase in competition amongst the WTMs in China. Being relatively new, this creates a fertile environment for local Chinese WTMs that is ripe for study and analysis.

It sets out to explore the major actors, important environmental laws, regulations and standards, the relationship between the central and local governments, and overall environmental policy performance of the city, and see if it matches the general pattern of Japan’s environmental governance. Kitakyushu is a city located in the Fukuoka Prefecture in the Northwest Japan. It grew out of a very typical Japanese history of modernization and industrialization, and became one of the most prosperous industrial cities in Japan. However, it soon became a pollution hell, and the government and local business began to react to the citizen complaints very quickly and in a timely manner.

It sets out to explore the major actors, important environmental laws, regulations and standards, the relationship between the central and local governments, and overall environmental policy performance of the city, and see if it matches the general pattern of Japan’s environmental governance. Kitakyushu is a city located in the Fukuoka Prefecture in the Northwest Japan. It grew out of a very typical Japanese history of modernization and industrialization, and became one of the most prosperous industrial cities in Japan. However, it soon became a pollution hell, and the government and local business began to react to the citizen complaints very quickly and in a timely manner. The paper demonstrates that the environmental governance of Kitakyushu city shows similar pattern of Japan’s general environmental governance, which is top down and more centralized.

Integrated solid waste management integrates cleaner and more sustainable production strategies by reducing resource consumption and applying mechanisms found in natural ecosystems to industrial systems.

We focus on the EU End of Waste (EoW) policy, which aims at reducing negative impacts on the environment through the minimization of generated waste. At the same time, the EU climate objectives set challenging goals for the industry to lower greenhouse gas emissions. We argue that the goals of these two policies are conflicting: under certain circumstances, the EoW will lead into increased greenhouse gas emissions because of a number of negative feedback effects that function on multiple spatial and temporal scales.To assess the effects of waste recovery on greenhouse gas emissions, we carry out a consequential life-cycle inventory on a proposed industrial ecosystem around the Gulf of Bothnia between Finland and Sweden. The system recovers currently unutilized steelmaking dust and slag from four steel mills in Finland and Sweden and converts them into iron and zinc raw materials in a novel rotary hearth furnace. The recovered iron is led back into the blast furnace of one of the steel mills and zinc is treated in an existing zinc plant. In the European scale, the model system is significant in size, serving thus as a model for integrated EoW and carbon footprint assessments in other similar cases within the EU.The analysis reveals the relative greenhouse gas emissions from raw material extraction and production, heat and power generation, transport and the production process itself, in comparison to the present system with limited material recovery. To test the model viability, we conduct a sensitivity analysis with respect to increasing energy and production capacity. Our analysis shows that from the point of view of a single operator, material recovery may bring noteworthy reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. If the scale of the assessment is expanded beyond the confines of a single plant, however, we find limited potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions through further recovery of steelmaking residues. In conclusion, we provide policy recommendations with which the EoW paradigm can provide better support for climate change mitigation on a regional scale. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of ISs and EIPs is to minimise inefficient material and energy use by utilising local by-product and energy flows. Industrial symbioses tend to develop through spontaneous action of economic actors, for gaining of economic benefit, but these systems can be designed and promoted via policy instruments as well. A literature review showed that national programmes for eco-industrial parks can be found in different parts of the world. In the action programmes and other sustainable consumption and production (SCP) policy documents of the EU, on the other hand, industrial symbioses gain less recognition as a path to enhanced sustainable production. In this article, we consider this and also analyse how the evolution and environmental performance of an industrial symbiosis system centred on a Finnish pulp and paper mill have been affected by SCP policy instruments. With regard to the system forming the subject of the case study, and Finnish industrial systems in general, policy instruments have succeeded in reducing emissions but not in systematically encouraging operators toward symbiosis-like activities. All in all, few studies exist on the overall impact of policy instruments promoting design of eco-industrial parks. It is not self-evident that symbiosis-like production systems would be sustainable in every case, as the background assumptions for political promotion of EIPs suggest. We concluded that industrial symbioses should be analysed and developed on a life cycle basis, with documentation of the real environmental benefits due to efficient resource use and decreased emissions in comparison to stand-alone production. ISs can then bring eco-competitiveness to companies in relation to SCP tools, such as environmental permits, ecolabels, and future product regulation based on the Ecodesign Directive in Europe.

Industrial clusters have the potential to significantly increase energy efficiency by energy collaboration. In this paper Sweden's largest chemical cluster is analysed using the total site analysis (TSA) method. TSA delivers targets for the amount of utility consumed and generated through excess energy recovery by the different processes. The method enables investigation of opportunities to deliver waste heat from one process to another using a common utility system.The cluster consists of 5 chemical companies producing a variety of products, including polyethylene (PE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), amines, ethylene, oxygen/nitrogen and plasticisers. The companies already work together by exchanging material streams. In this study the potential for energy collaboration is analysed in order to reach an industrial symbiosis. The overall heating and cooling demands of the site are around 442 MW and 953 MW, respectively. 122 MW of heat is produced in boilers and delivered to the processes.TSA is used to stepwise design a site-wide utility system which improves energy efficiency. It is shown that heat recovery in the cluster can be increased by 129 MW, i.e. the current utility demand could be completely eliminated and further 7 MW excess steam can be made available. The proposed retrofitted utility system involves the introduction of a site-wide hot water circuit, increased recovery of low pressure steam and shifting of heating steam pressure to lower levels in a number heat exchangers when possible. Qualitative evaluation of the suggested measures shows that 60 MW of the savings potential could to be achieved with moderate changes to the process utility system corresponding to 50% of the heat produced from purchased fuel in the boilers of the cluster.Further analysis showed that after implementation of the suggested energy efficiency measures there is still a large excess of heat at temperatures of up to 137 degrees C.

To study the carbon dioxide (CO(2)) neutrality of the park, we made a park-wide inventory for 2007 of the CO(2) emissions due to energy consumption (electricity and fossil fuel) and waste incineration, as well as an inventory of the existing renewable electricity and heat generation. The definition of CO(2) neutrality in Flanders only considers CO(2) released as a consequence of consumption or generation of electricity, not the CO(2) emitted when fossil fuel is consumed for heat generation.

To study the carbon dioxide (CO(2)) neutrality of the park, we made a park-wide inventory for 2007 of the CO(2) emissions due to energy consumption (electricity and fossil fuel) and waste incineration, as well as an inventory of the existing renewable electricity and heat generation.

In this paper, we discuss the energy intensity of the industrial sectors of the Yangtze River Delta, consisting of Shanghai City and the neighboring province of Jiangsu-the fastest economically developing region of the country-and argue possible strategies for energy efficient industrial activities there. We first examine the historical trends of energy intensity associated with industrial sectors and study the factors affecting the evolution of these trends by applying decomposition analysis.

Thus, appropriate measures are urgently needed to lower energy intensity and consumption. Based upon these analyses as well as the Chinese government's policy orientation, we propose two options as alternative scenarios for improving practices in energy-intensive industries, particularly targeting the cement and steel production sectors. These options are: (1) diffusion of highly energy efficient technologies into these industries, and (2) promotion of a circular economy and industrial symbiosis.

Bounded by a sustainability vision for the region in a carbon-constrained world, regional industrial ecologies in 2050 were backcast around three themes: bio-industries and renewables (no coal usage); electricity from coal with carbon capture and storage (low to high coal usage); and coal to products such as hydrogen, ammonia, diesel, methanol, plastics and char (demonstrating medium to high overall coal use relative to current levels).

However, premises and internal process optimisation on industrial parks is not considered sufficient to limit greenhouse emissions in Flanders. Structural transition is called for, aiming for industrial clustering and energy autonomy based on renewables. Therefore, the concept of industrial symbiosis is analysed to determine how it could improve the energy-related carbon management on industrial parks. This article explores the literature on industrial symbiosis and eco-industrial parks searching for specific energy strategies, and is illustrated with case studies. Energy management on industrial parks can be integrated in the entire development process and park management. Maximising efficiency is a promising local optimisation issue, in which business should be engaged, stimulated and facilitated. By clustering buildings and processes, by energy exchange, collective production and joint contracting of energy services, local synergies can be intensified. Yet, uncertainty and variability in time of energy consumption can keep developers from tailoring industrial park design and utilities.

While framing these self-help development initiatives as object cases of Public-Private-Community Participation (PPCP), the paper points the attention of urban planners to the evolving rural-urban nexuses and the new planning mandate they are instigating.

Many CO2 reduction options have been proposed in literature for both sectors. They are mainly focused on CO2 capture in power plants, but, in the short-term, industrial processes are going to play an important role in achieving this objective.In particular, one of the disadvantages in cement plants is that CO2 has two sources: fuel combustion and lime calcination. For this reason, proposed solutions could partially reduce a limited quantity of emissions. The sector is forced to use CO2 capture systems for further reductions. Preliminary results about the implementation of post-combustion and oxyfuel combustion systems for CO2 capture show low energetic penalties and important emissions reduction. Nevertheless, a detailed analysis, not only of CO2 emissions, but of raw materials and its disposal, primary energy and waste energy, could give optimum results from an environmental, energetic, and economic perspective.The combination/integration by industrial symbiosis of a power plant, a cement plant and a CO2 capture system is proposed in this work. Calcium-looping is chosen as the most suitable CO2 capture option for this application. The re-use of waste CaO coming from CO2 capture in the cement plant, and the utilization of waste energy from a clinker cooling and capture system to produce additional power are the main advantages of this proposal. Process flow diagrams and heat and mass balances are calculated and presented in this work. Results show a low value of the CO2 avoided cost, 12.4 (sic)/t, that is smaller than in any other combination of power plant with capture system or cement plant plus capture system, making this proposal economically very attractive. Moreover, an important amount of CO2 emissions is avoided -94% - due to the energetic efficiency augmentation, the reduction of raw and decarbonizated materials, and the CO2 capture system.

To help drive the required behaviour change for increased sustainable practice the Government in England signalled up in the Strategy the intention to launch a Zero Waste Places (ZWP) initiative to develop innovative and exemplary practice. By inviting places (including cities, towns and rural communities) to bid for ZWP status, the successful applicants were then expected to become exemplars of good environmental practice on all waste issues. The ZWP programme commenced in October 2008 with the selection of 6 distinct places based upon an application by a partnership containing a Local Authority or in one case a Regional Development Agency. The places ranged in size from the very small (one street of 201 properties) to a Region of England (5 million population). These 6 were chosen from an initial list of 12 applicants via a rigorous selection process against fixed criteria that were designed to support Zero Waste practice. The funding was (sic)70,258 and the mean was (sic)11,709. The overall assessment suggests that the Local Authorities and their project partners rose to the challenge of zero waste and in most cases met or even exceeded their objectives (meeting at least 80% of aims and planned actions) and achieved high value for money in terms of Government funded initiatives.

In particular, we employ the two-sided market theory to analyze the strategic relationships among stakeholders in the smart phone market. For example, the issues on net neutrality and net usage charging are applied to the business relation between an app provider and a platform coalition like Apple's iOS and AT&T. We define the net neutrality in terms of fairness and non-discrimination of net usage charging between these providers. However, along the line of the general pattern in the evolution of the network industry, we also consider the possibility of relaxation of the net neutrality concept in order to admit network providers' differentiated operations of their networks based on the service types and characteristics. Under a rather strict enforcement of net neutrality, studies on the two-sided market present the possibility of cross-subsidization as well as the internalization of indirect network externality. Furthermore, some literatures show the instability of interior equilibrium where both platforms coexist. Thus, the policy authority needs to be cautious when applying the net neutrality policy.

First, the current cost-based approach has its limitations in correctly calculating net usage charging in the platform-based ecosystem due to inherent difficulties in estimating network capacity in the two-sided market.

In particular, we employ the two-sided market theory to analyze the strategic relationships among stakeholders in the smart phone market. For example, the issues on net neutrality and net usage charging are applied to the business relation between an app provider and a platform coalition like Apple's iOS and AT&T. We define the net neutrality in terms of fairness and non-discrimination of net usage charging between these providers. However, along the line of the general pattern in the evolution of the network industry, we also consider the possibility of relaxation of the net neutrality concept in order to admit network providers' differentiated operations of their networks based on the service types and characteristics. Under a rather strict enforcement of net neutrality, studies on the two-sided market present the possibility of cross-subsidization as well as the internalization of indirect network externality. Furthermore, some literatures show the instability of interior equilibrium where both platforms coexist. Thus, the policy authority needs to be cautious when applying the net neutrality policy. Next, we present some directions for a development of new net usage charging scheme under the assumption of net neutrality relaxation. First, the current cost-based approach has its limitations in correctly calculating net usage charging in the platform-based ecosystem due to inherent difficulties in estimating network capacity in the two-sided market.

Research shows that many information and communication technology (ICT) tools for industrial symbiosis development have been created, but the results of those efforts are unclear. Drawing from advancements in knowledge-based economics and management, this article applies a knowledge-based framework to evaluate opportunities for ICT within industrial symbiosis development.

Direct inter-firm reuse is the cornerstone of the phenomenon termed industrial symbiosis, where firms cooperate in the exchange of material and energy resources. This study applies material flow analysis to an economically diverse industrial area in South India to characterize the recovery, reuse and recycling of industrial residuals.

This paper proposes a new method which is an establishment of both an access indicator system and an extendable optimal degree evaluation model. The indicator system comprises seven primary indicators and twenty-seven secondary indicators. The first three primary indicators, matching the existing industrial chains or not, park capacity and park environmental performance improvement, are proposed from the perspective of an EIP. The others including eco-design, economic benefit, utilization of resources, and pollution control, are suggested from the point of view of enterprises. This new access indicator system provides a basis for evaluating candidate enterprises. The extendable optimal degree evaluation which was proposed by Prof. Caiwen is a method to assess the satisfactoriness of all the indicators and to assign an optimal degree order to each candidate enterprise accordingly. There are four steps to conduct the evaluation after establishing the access indicator system: (1) selecting correlation function; (2) calculating correlations; (3) assigning weights and current values of indicators; and (4) calculating the optimal degree of all the candidate enterprises. The enterprises can be ranked based on optimal degree results. The highest-ranked enterprise should have the highest priority of entering the EIP. This study provides the specifics of applying the method by examining the case of Yantai Economy Technology Development Zone EIP (YTEIP) in Shandong province.

To evaluate the potential of reducing the total CO2 emission through industrial symbiosis, alternative industrial symbiosis scenarios are then designed based on a questionnaire survey of 57 major local industries, to which 35 companies appropriately responded. The main focus of this paper is to calculate the total CO2 emission for different scenarios by adopting a life cycle CO2 analysis method. We then present recommendations on further improvement with consideration of the local realities. Our findings are that industrial symbiosis practices in Kawasaki Eco-town still have room for improvement in that greenhouse gas emissions can be further reduced and natural resources conserved through effective material exchanges, not only between companies, but also with the surrounding area.

Based on the results we conclude, that input-output based LCA can be used to analyze the global impacts of an industrial symbiosis, but a careful interpretation of the results is necessary in order to understand the influence of aggregation and allocation.\",\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es902673m\",\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es902673m\"\n\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/sys.20139\",\"Using Systems Engineering to Create a Framework for Evaluating Industrial Symbiosis Options\",\"Sopha, Bertha Maya; Fet, Annik Magerholm; Keitsch, Martina Maria; Haskins, Cecilia\",\"SYSTEMS ENGINEERING\",\"13\",\"2\",2010,\"149 160\",\"J\",\"Sopha, Bertha Maya; Fet, Annik Magerholm; Keitsch, Martina Maria; Haskins, Cecilia\",NA,NA,\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"Using Systems Engineering to Create a Framework for Evaluating Industrial Symbiosis Options\",NA,NA,\"\",\"\",NA,NA,NA,\"SYSTEMS ENGINEERING\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"13\",\"2\",\"\",NA,\"149\",\"160\",\"\",\"10.1002/sys.20139\",NA,\"\",\"SUM 2010\",2010,\"Motivated by the success of industrial symbiosis at Kalundborg, Denmark, there have been many attempts to establish industrial symbiosis around the world Modeling the complex system that underlies an industrial symbiosis provides much needed understanding of these interactions in the planning stage Therefore, guidance and/or a framework are needed to identify \"\"what to model\"\" and to keep the modeling process on track This paper applies systems engineering to create a framework for modeling industrial symbiosis The proposed framework provides a practical road map for the modeling process that connects relevant concepts and techniques A case is introduced to illustrate use of the framework (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc Syst Eng 13 149-160,2010\",NA,NA,\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",4,0,0,0,0,4,NA,NA,\"1098-1241\",\"\",\"\",\"WOS:000277187900004\",NA,NA,\"Using Systems Engineering to Create a Framework for Evaluating Industrial Symbiosis Options Motivated by the success of industrial symbiosis at Kalundborg, Denmark, there have been many attempts to establish industrial symbiosis around the world Modeling the complex system that underlies an industrial symbiosis provides much needed understanding of these interactions in the planning stage Therefore, guidance and/or a framework are needed to identify \"\"what to model\"\" and to keep the modeling process on track This paper applies systems engineering to create a framework for modeling industrial symbiosis The proposed framework provides a practical road map for the modeling process that connects relevant concepts and techniques A case is introduced to illustrate use of the framework (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc Syst Eng 13 149-160,2010\",\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/sys.20139\",\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/sys.20139\"\n\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2009.12.019\",\"Waste management policies for industrial symbiosis development: case studies in European countries\",\"Costa, Ines; Massard, Guillaume; Agarwal, Abhishek\",\"JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION\",\"18\",\"8\",2010,\"815 822\",\"J\",\"Costa, Ines; Massard, Guillaume; Agarwal, Abhishek\",NA,NA,\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"Waste management policies for industrial symbiosis development: case studies in European countries\",NA,NA,\"\",\"\",NA,NA,NA,\"JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"18\",\"8\",\"\",NA,\"815\",\"822\",\"\",\"10.1016/j.jclepro.2009.12.019\",NA,\"\",\"MAY 2010\",2010,\"Industrial symbiosis (IS) emerged as a self-organizing business strategy among firms that are willing to cooperate to improve their economic and environmental performance.

A industrial waste transaction price model is constructed to maximize the total symbiotic benefit between the two enterprises formed a industrial symbiosis relationship, and the model solution process and a numerical example is also proposed, which provides a reasonable approach to price the industrial waste\",\"http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000297300100058&DestLinkType=FullRecord&DestApp=ALL_WOS\",\"http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000297300100058&DestLinkType=FullRecord&DestApp=ALL_WOS\"\n\"http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000288148500004&DestLinkType=FullRecord&DestApp=ALL_WOS\",\"Research on the construction of China green industrial park early warning index system\",\"Zou, Na\",\"2010 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MANAGEMENT SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING (MSE 2010), VOL 2\",\"\",\"\",2010,\"10 13\",\"B\",\"Zou, Na\",NA,NA,\"\",\"\",\"\",\"Luo, Q\",\"\",\"Research on the construction of China green industrial park early warning index system\",NA,NA,\"\",\"\",NA,NA,NA,\"2010 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MANAGEMENT SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING (MSE 2010), VOL 2\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",NA,\"10\",\"13\",\"\",\"\",NA,\"\",\"2010\",2010,\"With the rapid development of industrial park, resources and environmental problems have become more apparent.

However, biodiesel production generates large amounts of waste and wastewater. This research aspires to adopt industrial ecology measures to alleviate environmental problems encountered in the biodiesel industry in Thailand. The proposed implementation options included clean technology and waste exchange measures. Five biodiesel production factories were selected to analyse material flow and balance in the production processes. The results show that 1 m3 biodiesel production generated 8kg of spent bleaching earth, 140kg of glycerine and 0.50m3 of wastewater with a chemical oxygen demand (COD) content of up to 170,000mg/L.

However, biodiesel production generates large amounts of waste and wastewater. This research aspires to adopt industrial ecology measures to alleviate environmental problems encountered in the biodiesel industry in Thailand. The proposed implementation options included clean technology and waste exchange measures. Five biodiesel production factories were selected to analyse material flow and balance in the production processes. The results show that 1 m3 biodiesel production generated 8kg of spent bleaching earth, 140kg of glycerine and 0.50m3 of wastewater with a chemical oxygen demand (COD) content of up to 170,000mg/L.

Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, the term 'eco-city' remained mainly a concept, a collection of ideas and propositions about sustainable urban planning, transportation, housing, public participation and social justice, with practical examples relatively few and far between. Since the mid 2000s, the phenomenon appears to have become increasingly global and mainstream, against the background of the international recognition of the scale and severity of climate change and rapid urbanisation, particularly in the developing world.

Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, the term 'eco-city' remained mainly a concept, a collection of ideas and propositions about sustainable urban planning, transportation, housing, public participation and social justice, with practical examples relatively few and far between. Since the mid 2000s, the phenomenon appears to have become increasingly global and mainstream, against the background of the international recognition of the scale and severity of climate change and rapid urbanisation, particularly in the developing world. To date, there have been few systematic surveys of eco-cities. This paper presents the findings of a global survey carried out in 2009. The study maps, analyses and compares some 79 identified eco-city initiatives, and addresses questions, such as what are key features that distinguish eco-cities from 'normal' cities; how to define them; why they have become international and mainstream in a short period of time; and what kind of issues their implementation in different contexts raise.

Given the large presence of EIPs in the local economies, these results suggest that EIPs play a key role in promoting sustainable development in China.\",\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11625-009-0078-0\",\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11625-009-0078-0\"\n\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2009.06.009\",\"Applying agent-based modeling to the evolution of eco-industrial systems\",\"Cao, Kai; Feng, Xiao; Wan, Hui\",\"ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS\",\"68\",\"11\",2009,\"2868 2876\",\"J\",\"Cao, Kai; Feng, Xiao; Wan, Hui\",NA,NA,\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"Applying agent-based modeling to the evolution of eco-industrial systems\",NA,NA,\"\",\"\",NA,NA,NA,\"ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"68\",\"11\",\"\",NA,\"2868\",\"2876\",\"\",\"10.1016/j.ecolecon.2009.06.009\",NA,\"\",\"SEP 15 2009\",2009,\"Agent-based modeling is simply a modeling technique for describing complex adaptive systems in a form that can be solved by computers.

Focus is given to the management of water among multiple processes in a common. EIP facility. Recycle, reuse, and separation using interception devices are considered as possible strategies for managing, wastewater. A source-interception-sink structural representation is used to embed potential configurations of interest. The representation accounts for the possibilities of direct recycle, material (waste) exchange, mixing and segregation of different streams, separation and treatment in interception units, and allocation to process users (sinks). Then, the EIP design problem is formulated as an optimization, program whose objective is to minimize cost of the EIP while determining optimal recycle and separation strategies.

Focus is given to the management of water among multiple processes in a common. EIP facility. Recycle, reuse, and separation using interception devices are considered as possible strategies for managing, wastewater. A source-interception-sink structural representation is used to embed potential configurations of interest. The representation accounts for the possibilities of direct recycle, material (waste) exchange, mixing and segregation of different streams, separation and treatment in interception units, and allocation to process users (sinks). Then, the EIP design problem is formulated as an optimization, program whose objective is to minimize cost of the EIP while determining optimal recycle and separation strategies. A case study is solved to illustrate the applicability of the devised approach.

Despite the fact that the number of examples of regional resource synergies around the world is growing, the reuse of inorganic by-products (e.g. bauxite residue, fly ash, kiln dusts, gypsum, slag) in Australia have not yet materialised on a significant scale. This is due to the fragmented approach adopted in the past and a range of barriers associated with their reuse. The drivers and barriers for inorganic by-product reuses appear to fall in nine broad categories: regulation, economics, community, technology, transportation, confidential and commercial issues, risk and liabilities, industry focus and priorities, and region specific issues. This paper shows that significant potential exist for the establishment of large volume reuse of these inorganic by-products in Australia, using the Kwinana Industrial Area as a case study. The inorganic by-products available in Kwinana could be used to Supply the growing demand for already scarce building and construction materials in Western Australia. Although regulatory reuse standards exist elsewhere (e.g. European Union, USA), one of the main obstacles for the Kwinana industries is the absence of standard application protocols to allow for the routine use of their inorganic by-products. A coordinated stakeholder approach is being facilitated and applied in Kwinana that targets the realisation of large volume reuse opportunities that have both a good business and sustainability case and also government and community support. Based on the Kwinana experiences, this paper provides perspectives and learnings for elsewhere in Australia and in Countries where current regulatory frameworks do not encourage or restrict the uptake of inorganic by-product reuses on a large scale.

In this work, given the high CPU time demanded for simulating the ecological complex, a procedure for screening the alternatives of CO2 allocation in the complex is investigated and a reduced Pareto set for the proposed Ecological Chemical Complex is presented.\",\"http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000287727800320&DestLinkType=FullRecord&DestApp=ALL_WOS\",\"http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000287727800320&DestLinkType=FullRecord&DestApp=ALL_WOS\"\n\"http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000287727800337&DestLinkType=FullRecord&DestApp=ALL_WOS\",\"Multi-Objective Game Models for Chemical Industrial Park\",\"Jia Xiao-Ping; Wang Fang; Xiang Shu-Guang\",\"10TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON PROCESS SYSTEMS ENGINEERING\",\"27\",\"\",2009,\"2019 2024\",\"S\",\"Jia Xiao-Ping; Wang Fang; Xiang Shu-Guang\",NA,NA,\"\",\"\",\"\",\"deBritoAlves, RM; doNascimento, CAO; Biscaia, EC\",\"\",\"Multi-Objective Game Models for Chemical Industrial Park\",NA,NA,\"\",\"\",NA,NA,NA,\"10TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON PROCESS SYSTEMS ENGINEERING\",\"\",\"Computer-Aided Chemical Engineering\",\"\",\"27\",\"\",\"\",NA,\"2019\",\"2024\",\"\",\"\",NA,\"\",\"2009\",2009,\"Chemical industrial park is a practical form of industrial symbiosis network to emerge to achieve the goal of resource sharing among the participating chemical plants.

To prevent catastrophic wildfires, highly inflammable pine forests and dense shrub thickets should be converted by active fire and fuel management into floristically enriched open woodlands and multispecies, multilayered recreation forests.\",\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1560/IJPS.57.1-2.131\",\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1560/IJPS.57.1-2.131\"\n\"http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=KJD:ART001387117&DestLinkType=FullRecord&DestApp=ALL_WOS\",\"Basic study on Eco-industrial Park utilizing thermal effluents as heat source\",\"Kim, Donggyu; Kang, Daeseok; Chung, Yong Hyun\",\"JOUNAL OF FISHERIES AND MARINE SCIENCES EDUCATION\",\"21\",\"3\",2009,\"400 408\",\"J\",\"Kim, Donggyu; Kang, Daeseok; Chung, Yong Hyun\",NA,NA,\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"Basic study on Eco-industrial Park utilizing thermal effluents as heat source\",NA,NA,\"온배수를 열원으로 활용하는 생태산업단지 조성에 관한 기초 연구\",\"\",NA,NA,NA,\"JOUNAL OF FISHERIES AND MARINE SCIENCES EDUCATION\",\"수산해양교육연구\",\"\",\"\",\"21\",\"3\",\"\",NA,\"400\",\"408\",\"\",\"\",NA,\"\",\"2009\",2009,\"The purpose of this study is to know the concept of Eco-industrial Park and How to use the thermal effluents from power plants.

Because of their rapid proliferation and the lack of accepted and common characteristics, the performance of these projects has been difficult to evaluate. In 2006, the former State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) of China became the first national organization to establish a national standard for eco-industrial parks. This paper aims to explore the applicability and feasibility of the selected indicators. First, it presents the details of this new standard. Second, the feasibility of the new standard is explored by applying the indicators to two industrial zones in China. The benefits and challenges faced in applying the indicators are then discussed in relation to the literature.

Because of their rapid proliferation and the lack of accepted and common characteristics, the performance of these projects has been difficult to evaluate. In 2006, the former State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) of China became the first national organization to establish a national standard for eco-industrial parks. This paper aims to explore the applicability and feasibility of the selected indicators. First, it presents the details of this new standard. Second, the feasibility of the new standard is explored by applying the indicators to two industrial zones in China. The benefits and challenges faced in applying the indicators are then discussed in relation to the literature. The analysis demonstrates that the new indicators have a fairly narrow focus on eco-efficiency, rather than a broad objective of ecologically sustainable industrial development. Nevertheless, the Chinese standard is a useful beginning. In future, the authors suggest that this set of indicators be revised to add ecological dimensions that will help promote more sustainable development of industrial parks.\",\"http://dx.doi.org/10.3843/SusDev.15.6:6\",\"http://dx.doi.org/10.3843/SusDev.15.6:6\"\n\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10098-007-0122-7\",\"Applying industrial ecosystem indicators: case of Pielinen Karelia, Finland\",\"Okkonen, Lasse\",\"CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY\",\"10\",\"4\",2008,\"327 339\",\"J\",\"Okkonen, Lasse\",NA,NA,\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"Applying industrial ecosystem indicators: case of Pielinen Karelia, Finland\",NA,NA,\"\",\"\",NA,NA,NA,\"CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"10\",\"4\",\"\",NA,\"327\",\"339\",\"\",\"10.1007/s10098-007-0122-7\",NA,\"\",\"NOV 2008\",2008,\"This paper presents an industrial ecological insight into local waste management in Pielinen Karelia, Finland.

Additional primary data derived from the main author's personal involvement in several circular economy initiatives were also employed.\",\"http://dx.doi.org/10.3843/SusDev.15.3:6\",\"http://dx.doi.org/10.3843/SusDev.15.3:6\"\n\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1530-9290.2008.00063.x\",\"Nanotechnology: A new organism in the industrial ecosystem?\",\"Clilft, Roland; Lloyd, Shannon\",\"JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY\",\"12\",\"3\",2008,\"259 262\",\"J\",\"Clilft, Roland; Lloyd, Shannon\",NA,NA,\"\",\"\",\"Clift, Roland/0000-0003-1183-496X\",\"\",\"\",\"Nanotechnology: A new organism in the industrial ecosystem?\",NA,NA,\"\",\"\",NA,NA,NA,\"JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"12\",\"3\",\"\",NA,\"259\",\"262\",\"\",\"10.1111/j.1530-9290.2008.00063.x\",NA,\"\",\"JUN 2008\",2008,\"\",NA,NA,\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",0,0,0,0,1,1,NA,NA,\"1088-1980\",\"\",\"\",\"WOS:000259525200001\",NA,NA,\"Nanotechnology: A new organism in the industrial ecosystem? \",\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1530-9290.2008.00063.x\",\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1530-9290.2008.00063.x\"\n\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2007.07.002\",\"Industrial symbiosis of very large-scale photovoltaic manufacturing\",\"Pearce, Joshua M.\",\"RENEWABLE ENERGY\",\"33\",\"5\",2008,\"1101 1108\",\"J\",\"Pearce, Joshua M.\",NA,NA,\"\",\"Pearce, Joshua/D-2052-2010; Pearce, Joshua/C-9240-2013\",\"Pearce, Joshua/0000-0002-4894-5332; Pearce, Joshua/0000-0001-9802-3056\",\"\",\"\",\"Industrial symbiosis of very large-scale photovoltaic manufacturing\",NA,NA,\"\",\"\",NA,NA,NA,\"RENEWABLE ENERGY\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"33\",\"5\",\"\",NA,\"1101\",\"1108\",\"\",\"10.1016/j.renene.2007.07.002\",NA,\"\",\"MAY 2008\",2008,\"In order to stabilize the global climate, the world's governments must make significant commitments to drastically reduce global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. One of the most promising methods of curbing GHG emissions is a world transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy. Solar photovoltaic (PV) cells offer a technically sustainable solution to the projected enormous future energy demands. This article explores utilizing industrial symbiosis to obtain economies of scale and increased manufacturing efficiencies for solar PV cells in order for solar electricity to compete economically with fossil fuel-fired electricity. The state of PV manufacturing, the market and the effects of scale on both are reviewed. Government policies necessary to construct a multi-gigaWatt PV factory and complementary policies to protect existing solar companies are outlined and the technical requirements for a symbiotic industrial system are explored to increase the manufacturing efficiency while improving the environmental impact of PV. The results of the analysis show that an eight-factory industrial symbiotic system can be viewed as a medium-term investment by any government, which will not only obtain direct financial return, but also an improved global environment. The technical concepts and policy limitations to this approach were analyzed and it was found that symbiotic growth will help to mitigate many of the limitations of PV and is likely to catalyze mass manufacturing of PV by transparently demonstrating that large-scale PV manufacturing is technically feasible and reaches an enormous untapped market for PV with low costs.

These results suggest that we cannot assign loop closing to any particular spatial scale a priori nor can we conceive of closing the loop via RRWT firms in terms of monolithic networks bounded in space or place with internal material flows.\",\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/jiec.2007.1029\",\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/jiec.2007.1029\"\n\"http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000244433600007&DestLinkType=FullRecord&DestApp=ALL_WOS\",\"Industrial symbiosis in the Australian minerals industry - The cases of Kwinana and Gladstone\",\"van Beers, Dick; Corder, Glen; Bossilkov, Albena; van Berkel, Rene\",\"JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY\",\"11\",\"1\",2007,\"55 72\",\"J\",\"van Beers, Dick; Corder, Glen; Bossilkov, Albena; van Berkel, Rene\",NA,NA,\"\",\"Minerals Institute, Sustainable/F-8043-2010\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"Industrial symbiosis in the Australian minerals industry - The cases of Kwinana and Gladstone\",NA,NA,\"\",\"\",NA,NA,NA,\"JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"11\",\"1\",\"\",NA,\"55\",\"72\",\"\",\"\",NA,\"\",\"WIN 2007\",2007,\"The realization of regional synergies in industrial areas with intensive minerals processing provides a significant avenue toward sustainable resource processing.

The most effective and best example to follow is nature. Nature has no waste. All wastes in nature are foods in its ecological cycle. Products/services in industrial society should follow this example: waste equals food. William McDonough defines this system, cradle‐to‐cradle. This is a closed loop cycle; therefore, sustainable. Ezio Manzini challenges designers to re‐orient creativity towards sustainable solutions: based on strategic design and design for substantiality, with a focus on scenario building and solution development. Many existing examples of sustainable society encourage people that this sustainable society can be realized if it is planned and realized with no compromise. Once it is realized it is advantageous to all the components in the society: equity, ecology, and economy.\",\"http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=KJD:ART001270290&DestLinkType=FullRecord&DestApp=ALL_WOS\",\"http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=KJD:ART001270290&DestLinkType=FullRecord&DestApp=ALL_WOS\"\n\"http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=KJD:ART001205516&DestLinkType=FullRecord&DestApp=ALL_WOS\",\"A Study on the Development of Urban Environmental Evaluation Indicator and Its Application for the Fifth and Sixth Graders  based on the Eco-City Concept\",\"Nam, Young Sook; 장호창\",\"Journal of Korean Society for Environmental Education\",\"20\",\"2\",2007,\"78 92\",\"J\",\"Nam, Young Sook; 장호창\",NA,NA,\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"A Study on the Development of Urban Environmental Evaluation Indicator and Its Application for the Fifth and Sixth Graders  based on the Eco-City Concept\",NA,NA,\"생태 도시 개념을 적용한 도시 평가 지표 개발 및 활용 방안 연구 - 초등학교 5, 6학년을 중심으로 -\",\"\",NA,NA,NA,\"Journal of Korean Society for Environmental Education\",\"환경교육\",\"\",\"\",\"20\",\"2\",\"\",NA,\"78\",\"92\",\"\",\"\",NA,\"\",\"2007\",2007,\"The purpose of this study is to develop urban evaluation indicator and its application through the application of the eco-city concept.

We found that seed numbers and the number of species per soil sample increased during the 3 years of the study. The compositional similarity between seed bank and vegetation did increase for the 0-2 cm surface layer, and remained roughly constant for deeper soil layers.

The average greenhouse requires about 2.85 Gj/M-2/year primarily from natural gas combustion for providing both heat and CO2 for stimulating plant growth, with a total annual CO2 emission in the order of 2.5 million tones. The substitution of natural gas by biofuels will have a great potential for GHG emission reduction. The deterioration of local air quality in regions with intensive agricultural activities, on the other hand, is closely related to the emissions from animal barns, from manure storage, handling and land spreading.Approaches to address energy and emission issues for each industry in isolation have failed in the past because of the higher emissions associated with biomass fuel combustion and higher waste management cost for manure.

The traditional process used for manufacturing chromic oxide from chromite ore has low resources and energy efficiency. Moreover, large quantities of chromium-containing toxic solid wastes are discharged, posing serious pollution concerns. To reduce the environmental impact of this procedure, a new cleaner process was developed by the Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, PR China, based upon the 3Rs (Reduce, Recycle, Reuse) principles of cleaner production and industrial ecology; this new cleaner process utilizes resources more efficiently, and does not discharge emissions of chromium-containing waste residue. A demonstration plant featuring this process, as well as an Eco-Industrial Park (EIP) has been built in He'nan Province, PR China.

The traditional process used for manufacturing chromic oxide from chromite ore has low resources and energy efficiency. Moreover, large quantities of chromium-containing toxic solid wastes are discharged, posing serious pollution concerns. To reduce the environmental impact of this procedure, a new cleaner process was developed by the Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, PR China, based upon the 3Rs (Reduce, Recycle, Reuse) principles of cleaner production and industrial ecology; this new cleaner process utilizes resources more efficiently, and does not discharge emissions of chromium-containing waste residue. A demonstration plant featuring this process, as well as an Eco-Industrial Park (EIP) has been built in He'nan Province, PR China. The new cleaner process is a promising advancement for the industrial production of chromic oxide (Cr2O3) as well as other chromium compounds such as potassium chromate (K2CrO4) and potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7).

Advocates of industrial ecology suggest that by shifting the basis of industrial production from a linear to a closed loop system, these gains can be achieved. In recent years, concepts drawn from industrial ecology have been used to plan and develop eco-industrial parks (EIPs) that seek to increase business competitiveness, reduce waste and pollution, create jobs and improve working conditions. Despite a growing interest in EIPs, there have been few empirically informed studies that seek to explore the potential contribution such Ell's may make to sustainable development. This paper contributes to a developing sympathetic critique of industrial ecology by focusing on the key problems and dilemmas that arise in the course of developing eco-industrial parks, drawing upon empirical work conducted in the USA. The paper draws upon both an extensive survey of EIPs and in-depth interviews conducted with a range of stakeholders at ten US sites. As the paper reveals, EIPs in the USA are in their early stages and likewise their contribution to both economic development and environmental policy, let alone social policies, is complicated and inchoate. The empirical material reveals that key features of industrial ecology such as inter-firm networking and collaboration in the form of materials interchange and energy cascading are either absent or in the early planning stages. In each of the ten cases what is emerging is a form of EIP partly determined by the geographic setting and broader economic realities of the locality. While collaborative behaviour between firms is central to EIP development if the potential benefits of industrial ecology are to be realised, it is important to realise that such behaviour is difficult to develop from scratch through policy intervention. In conclusion, the paper suggests that expectations must be realistic for the community and location in question. As part of that realism, EIP projects must be designed to allow for a gradual approach, and each phase needs to be financially viable. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

An attempt is reported to bring together in one analysis the products, raw materials and services, accounting for their sustainable origin (history) and required treatment (future), considering possibilities for guided waste recovery and utilization in other areas of integrity and finally focusing on production/process management for maximum efficiency and sustainability through combined Emergy-Pinch analysis.\",\"http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000232156000026&DestLinkType=FullRecord&DestApp=ALL_WOS\",\"http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000232156000026&DestLinkType=FullRecord&DestApp=ALL_WOS\"\n\"http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000239705200076&DestLinkType=FullRecord&DestApp=ALL_WOS\",\"The simulation and control of EIPs' modeling based on multi-agent system\",\"Qin, Suntao\",\"Proceedings of the 2005 Conference of System Dynamics and Management Science, Vol 2: SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF ASIA PACIFIC\",\"\",\"\",2005,\"947 951\",\"B\",\"Qin, Suntao\",NA,NA,\"\",\"\",\"\",\"Wang, Q; Jia, JG; Wu, B; Li, X; Zhang, XD; Yan, G; Chen, J\",\"\",\"The simulation and control of EIPs' modeling based on multi-agent system\",NA,NA,\"\",\"\",NA,NA,NA,\"Proceedings of the 2005 Conference of System Dynamics and Management Science, Vol 2: SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF ASIA PACIFIC\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",NA,\"947\",\"951\",\"\",\"\",NA,\"\",\"2005\",2005,\"By using the theory of complex adaptive system and the strategy of control, organization and evolvement, a dynamic simulation modeling for Eco-Industrial Park based on agent is put forwards by the author, and then the technology of modeling and evolvement stability and control flexibility of model is discussed, a new theoretical and practical way is being given for the manager of EIPs.\",NA,NA,\"\",\"\",\"Conference of System Dynamics and Management ScienceConference of System Dynamics and Management Science\",\"NOV 04-06, 2005NOV 04-06, 2005\",\"Tongji Dev Inst; Tongji Univ, Sch Econ & Management; Fudan Univ, Sch Management; Univ Shanghai Sci & Technol; Ventana Syst Inc; Inst Syst Engn Nanchang Univ; Shanghai Suntek Technol Co Ltd; Fount Management Consulting Co LtdTongji Dev Inst; Tongji Univ, Sch Econ & Management; Fudan Univ, Sch Management; Univ Shanghai Sci & Technol; Ventana Syst Inc; Inst Syst Engn Nanchang Univ; Shanghai Suntek Technol Co Ltd; Fount Management Consulting Co Ltd\",\"Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINAShanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA\",0,0,0,0,0,0,NA,NA,\"\",\"\",\"7-900660-57-7\",\"WOS:000239705200076\",NA,NA,\"The simulation and control of EIPs' modeling based on multi-agent system By using the theory of complex adaptive system and the strategy of control, organization and evolvement, a dynamic simulation modeling for Eco-Industrial Park based on agent is put forwards by the author, and then the technology of modeling and evolvement stability and control flexibility of model is discussed, a new theoretical and practical way is being given for the manager of EIPs.\",\"http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000239705200076&DestLinkType=FullRecord&DestApp=ALL_WOS\",\"http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000239705200076&DestLinkType=FullRecord&DestApp=ALL_WOS\"\n\"http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000235925200049&DestLinkType=FullRecord&DestApp=ALL_WOS\",\"The research on modeling of Eco-Industrial Park evolving based on multi-agent system\",\"Qin, ST\",\"Proceedings of the 2005 International Conference on Management Science and Engineering\",\"\",\"\",2005,\"278 282\",\"B\",\"Qin, ST\",NA,NA,\"\",\"\",\"\",\"Zhang, H; Zhao, RM; Chen, L\",\"\",\"The research on modeling of Eco-Industrial Park evolving based on multi-agent system\",NA,NA,\"\",\"\",NA,NA,NA,\"Proceedings of the 2005 International Conference on Management Science and Engineering\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",NA,\"278\",\"282\",\"\",\"\",NA,\"\",\"2005\",2005,\"The Eco-Industrial Park system (EIPs) is taken as a complex adaptive system in this article.

Two emerging ecological planning approaches, landscape ecology and industrial ecology, are applied here to look at alternative ways of planning industrial parks. As an emerging field, landscape ecology provides different viewpoints from the traditional approach of natural conservation, which mainly focuses on the protection of nature. The approach of landscape ecology regards the environment as a land mosaic, a mixture of natural and urban environment, which concerns a manageable human-scale environment across one or two human generations. Industrial ecology, on the other hand, goes beyond the traditional \"\"end of pipe\"\" idea of pollution control and learns from the ecosystem concept. The current paper is an attempt to reconcile these two fields as an integrated approach to the planning of industrial areas. Using a case study of Singapore's Jurong Island industrial park. two fundamental issues behind the idea of landscape ecology and industrial ecology are raised. If raw materials, energy and by-products are more easily replaced or reused by technology and management, then research on industrial ecology and related knowledge will be crucial for developing natural resource substitution by innovative technology and new ways of environmental management. Where it is difficult to substitute natural resources, the skills of planning and managing natural resources will take priority over other strategies. In this situation, the knowledge of landscape ecology needs to be applied to the prediction, design and evaluation of ecologically optimum resource uses, patterns and processes in the mixture of natural, urban and industrial environment. A new concept, \"\"nurtured landscape\"\", is proposed for mediating between the natural ecosystem and the urban/ industrial environment.

First, each company attending the EIP project has its own strong necessities to take part in the project. Most of the necessities are related to the issue of public hatred to pollutants discharged by the pertinent company. However, the project unsuccessfully deals with the necessities because of some technical, economic and social obstacles. Second, the support of the public sector to the project seems quite inadequate. The public sector seems to lack proper policy means and will relating to the project. Third, the successful promotion of the project needs the long-range prospect and the trust in market mechanism.\",\"http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=KJD:ART001134927&DestLinkType=FullRecord&DestApp=ALL_WOS\",\"http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=KJD:ART001134927&DestLinkType=FullRecord&DestApp=ALL_WOS\"\n\"http://gateway.webofknowledge.com/gateway/Gateway.cgi?GWVersion=2&SrcApp=PARTNER_APP&SrcAuth=LinksAMR&KeyUT=WOS:000224660600023&DestLinkType=FullRecord&DestApp=ALL_WOS\",\"The research of creating mechanism and economical analysis on two-eco-industrial parks\",\"Qin, Y; Wu, CY; Xue, LH\",\"MANAGEMENT SCIENCES AND GLOBAL STRATEGIES IN THE 21ST CENTURY, VOLS 1 AND 2\",\"\",\"\",2004,\"150 155\",\"B\",\"Qin, Y; Wu, CY; Xue, LH\",NA,NA,\"\",\"\",\"\",\"Cheng, S\",\"\",\"The research of creating mechanism and economical analysis on two-eco-industrial parks\",NA,NA,\"\",\"\",NA,NA,NA,\"MANAGEMENT SCIENCES AND GLOBAL STRATEGIES IN THE 21ST CENTURY, VOLS 1 AND 2\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",NA,\"150\",\"155\",\"\",\"\",NA,\"\",\"2004\",2004,\"Applying the theory of industrial ecology into the paper, the authors analyze the creating mechanism, and conduct a comparative research on the patterns of industrial symbiosis in the process of the establishment of EIP from ecology and economics.

Experiments were conducted at the Canlubang Industrial Estate, in the town of Bay and in the Makiling Forest Reserve representing the industrial, agricultural and forest environments, respectively, from August 30, 2000 to May 2002.The population growth of A. mellifera in an agroecosystern was significantly higher than in the industrial and forest environments. The abundance of melliferous plants in the agroecosystem enhanced the population build-up of A. mellifera. The native species, Apis cerana and Apis dorsata, negatively affected the growth of A. mellifera colonies in the forest ecosystem by aggression and robbing of stores.

Experiments were conducted at the Canlubang Industrial Estate, in the town of Bay and in the Makiling Forest Reserve representing the industrial, agricultural and forest environments, respectively, from August 30, 2000 to May 2002.The population growth of A. mellifera in an agroecosystern was significantly higher than in the industrial and forest environments. The abundance of melliferous plants in the agroecosystem enhanced the population build-up of A. mellifera. The native species, Apis cerana and Apis dorsata, negatively affected the growth of A. mellifera colonies in the forest ecosystem by aggression and robbing of stores.

In Greece the Settlements of Social Housing, which were constructed during the 50's, are structurally debilitated and at the same time do not satisfy the contemporary requirements for comfortable living conditions. In this context, issues concerning the rehabilitation of these areas are of absolute priority.The Settlement of 'Saint John's', a Housing complex at the east part of Thessaloniki, is in a process of rehabilitation, which includes the reconstruction of the housing buildings and the incorporation of renewable energy techniques aiming at the energy autonomy of the settlement, which contributes to a sustainable development of the urban area. Apart from this, the main problem is the financing of such a large scale investment, since the residents are of low income and cannot respond to these demands. The project \"\"ECO-TOWN, Application of RES in Saint John's Settlement Renewal\"\", financed by the programme ALTENER, aims to offer to the residents of Saint John's a complete design project for the reconstruction of the housing buildings, including the new urban design based on bioclimatic principles, architectural design of the new housing typologies, selected solar systems and techniques that cover the needs of heating, cooling, domestic hot water and electricity. The foreseen application of a co-generation system, using natural gas, will cover the additional requirements of the buildings for heating, cooling and electricity, so the settlement will be energy autonomous. Under these conditions the new Settlement will provide clean air quality, without any harmful substances derived by using oil, especially CO2 and SO2,The most innovation of this project is the new Settlement will be reconstructed totally including renewable energy techniques- by Third Party Financing. The process of the selection of the Construction Company has been completed, after the auction of the project, based on the proposed implementations and using the antiparokhi system.

In Greece the Settlements of Social Housing, which were constructed during the 50's, are structurally debilitated and at the same time do not satisfy the contemporary requirements for comfortable living conditions. In this context, issues concerning the rehabilitation of these areas are of absolute priority.The Settlement of 'Saint John's', a Housing complex at the east part of Thessaloniki, is in a process of rehabilitation, which includes the reconstruction of the housing buildings and the incorporation of renewable energy techniques aiming at the energy autonomy of the settlement, which contributes to a sustainable development of the urban area. Apart from this, the main problem is the financing of such a large scale investment, since the residents are of low income and cannot respond to these demands. The project \"\"ECO-TOWN, Application of RES in Saint John's Settlement Renewal\"\", financed by the programme ALTENER, aims to offer to the residents of Saint John's a complete design project for the reconstruction of the housing buildings, including the new urban design based on bioclimatic principles, architectural design of the new housing typologies, selected solar systems and techniques that cover the needs of heating, cooling, domestic hot water and electricity. The foreseen application of a co-generation system, using natural gas, will cover the additional requirements of the buildings for heating, cooling and electricity, so the settlement will be energy autonomous. Under these conditions the new Settlement will provide clean air quality, without any harmful substances derived by using oil, especially CO2 and SO2,The most innovation of this project is the new Settlement will be reconstructed totally including renewable energy techniques- by Third Party Financing. The process of the selection of the Construction Company has been completed, after the auction of the project, based on the proposed implementations and using the antiparokhi system. Nowadays, the existent residents and the Developer Company are in the process of agreement, namely the selection of the specific apartment will be taken as antiparokhi by each proprietor, in order the contracts to be signed. This process is very difficult because the number of the properties amount about 230.

Information Systems (GIS) within the City of Los Angles (LA) municipal government in the context of eco-industrial redevelopment of brownfield sites. LA, like many cities around the world, has implemented a Brownfields Program to address the problem of urban blight arising from environmental impairment. The program has now expanded to consider eco-industrial concepts. The increasing and dual interests of quality job generation through industrial development and community-focused environmental protection have initiated investigative efforts on eco-industrial redevelopment by the City's Brownfields Team. Although the definition. and understanding of eco-industrial development varies, the City's efforts revolve around a broadly interpreted encouragement of networks among businesses to achieve maximum economic and environmental performance. This may include waste exchange, sustainable design, pollution prevention, service sharing, and life cycle analysis.The \"\"Industrial Symbiosis\"\" park in Kalundborg, Denmark, while exemplary, does not provide a model directly relevant to LA, with its different mix of industries and scarcity of undeveloped large tracts of land.

Information Systems (GIS) within the City of Los Angles (LA) municipal government in the context of eco-industrial redevelopment of brownfield sites. LA, like many cities around the world, has implemented a Brownfields Program to address the problem of urban blight arising from environmental impairment. The program has now expanded to consider eco-industrial concepts. The increasing and dual interests of quality job generation through industrial development and community-focused environmental protection have initiated investigative efforts on eco-industrial redevelopment by the City's Brownfields Team. Although the definition. and understanding of eco-industrial development varies, the City's efforts revolve around a broadly interpreted encouragement of networks among businesses to achieve maximum economic and environmental performance. This may include waste exchange, sustainable design, pollution prevention, service sharing, and life cycle analysis.The \"\"Industrial Symbiosis\"\" park in Kalundborg, Denmark, while exemplary, does not provide a model directly relevant to LA, with its different mix of industries and scarcity of undeveloped large tracts of land. Instead, the Brownfields Program may adapt the traditional model to its dense urban fabric by facilitating waste and materials exchanges among existing businesses and using redeveloping brownfields to fill-in the gaps in potential eco-industrial relationships.

Accordingly, our approach involves narrowing the design space (using response surfaces) and the subsequent direct investigation of the simulation model (using heuristics), Response surfaces have received considerable attention in optimization because of their capability to replace complex models with analytic equations, thereby increasing computational efficiency. However, doubts exist as to the usefulness of a response-surface approximation of an approximation of reality (i.e., a system dynamics model). We demonstrate the usefulness of response surfaces in system dynamics studies with a case study involving a high-level model of an industrial ecosystem; our intent in using response surfaces is not to replace the simulation models with analytic equations, but instead to direct attention to regions within the design space of the original simulation with the most desirable performance. Recommended changes to a system are based directly on the simulation model, not on response surfaces, avoiding the added level of approximation inherent in response surfaces.
