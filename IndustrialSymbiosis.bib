	abstract = {This article focuses on the effects of policy instruments for developing viable eco-industrial parks (EIPs) in China. We analyzed the root of China's national EIP program and inventoried the general instruments available to local authorities to shape and promote eco-industrial development. Empirical research conducted in Tianjin Economic-technological Development Area and Dalian Development Area led to the activities and actions conducted by local authorities. A quantitative method, technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution, was adopted to reveal the effects of policy instruments for comparative analysis. We conclude that the planned EIP model is useful in the early stage of EIP development, and, subsequently, it should be combined with a facilitated model to achieve long-term goals for eco-transformation. To this end, the policy package of economic, regulatory, and voluntary instruments should be integrated and tailored in alignment with the local situation.},

To date, however, proximity of symbiont companies has remained an abstract characteristic. By conducting a statistical analysis of synergies facilitated by the United Kingdom's National Industrial Symbiosis Programme during their first five years of operation, this article attempts to quantify geographic proximity and in the process provide practitioners with an insight into the movement trends of different waste streams. Among other it was found that the median distance materials travelled within a symbiotic relationship is 20.4 miles. It is argued that quantitative information of this form is of practical value for the effective deployment of industrial symbiosis practitioners and wider resource efficiency planning. The results and discussion presented within this article are specific to industrial symbiosis opportunities facilitated within the United Kingdom; the methodology and assessment of resource movement influences are, however, expected to be relevant to all countries in which industrial activity is similarly mature and diversified.},

In an IE, following the roundput analogy of a natural ecosystem, the industrial actors co-operate by utilising each other's waste material and energy flows and try and reduce the system virgin material and energy input as well as the waste and emission output. In a successful IE, a business-environment win-win might be possible because the raw material and energy costs, waste management costs, costs resulting from environmental legislation, as well as the image costs of the companies in the system and of the system as a whole, can be reduced. In this paper, the IE analogy includes the four basic principles of system development of ecosystems; roundput, diversity, locality and gradual change.

This study has been undertaken to compare the implication of the National Industrial symbiosis Programme (NISP) in the UK, regarded as an active EID case, with the Korean eco-industrial park scheme as a newly implemented one. The two EID models were analysed with a framework centred on three practical aspects: the underlying approach to EID, the organisational framework and the operational framework. Comparing the two models based on the three aspects, this study suggests several implications for the implementation of EID in Korea, including business centred approach, expanding EIPs to regional EID, standardising operational framework and developing innovative synergy generation tools.},

	abstract = {Algal biofuels are considered to be the only biomass-based fuel capable of producing the global fuel demand in terms of land constraint. However, its sustainable production and commercialization have been criticized with respect to its environmental impact, energy requirement, and economic potential. Hence, a viable approach to address such a concern is through synergistic networks between multiple industries in an eco-industrial park framework. Applying the concept of industrial symbiosis (IS), it enables the collaborative exchange of by-products and energy surplus between companies leading to inter-industry benefits. An algal bioenergy park (ABP) is a special example of an eco-industrial park focusing on algal biofuel production. It consists of anchor tenants and support tenants. The former are industries which comprise the core companies of the ABP while the latter are the considered industries which may complement the core companies in the production of algal biofuels. To encourage mutual benefit between companies in the ABP, satisfaction of individual targets such as production level and profitability must be met. Thus, a fuzzy mathematical programming approach is proposed in this study for the optimal design of an ABP with multiple conflicting objectives. The results revealed that in considering the support tenants, the annual profit of the ABP increased by 220 \% with a considerable amount of increase in the environmental emissions. The results of the study provide a rational basis for negotiations, signing contracts, and agreements between firms in an ABP. A hypothetical but realistic case study is presented to illustrate the developed model.},

	abstract = {The available energy resources are being depleted worldwide. Industrial symbiosis (IS) provides a promising approach for increasing the efficiency of energy utilization, with numerous studies reporting the superiority of this technology. However, studies quantifying the energy-saving efficiency of IS remain insufficient. This paper proposes an index system for the quantitative evaluation of the energy-saving efficiency of IS. Both energy-saving and financial indexes were selected, the former include the IS energy-saving index, the contribution rate of energy saved through IS, fractional energy savings, and cut rate of energy consumption per total output value; and the latter include the IS investment payback period, IS input–output ratio, net present value (NPV), and internal rate of return (IRR) of IS. The proposed methods were applied to a case study on the XF Industrial Park (XF IP), in the city of Liaocheng in Shandong Province of China. Three energy-saving channels using IS were found in the XF IP: (a) utilizing the energy of high-temperature materials among industrial processes, (b) recovering waste heat and steam between different processes, and (c) saving energy by sharing infrastructures. The results showed that the energy efficiency index of IS was 0.326, accounting for 34.6 \% of the comprehensive energy-saving index in 2011, and the fractional energy-savings were 12.42 \%. The index of energy consumption per total industrial output value varied from 90.9 tce/MRMB to 51.6 tce/MRMB. Thus, the cut rate of energy consumption per total industrial output value was 43.42 \%. The average values of the IS input–output ratio was 406.2 RMB/tce, 57.2 \% lower than the price of standard coal. Static investment payback period in the XF IP was 8.5 months, indicating that the XF IP began to earn profit 8.5 months after the construction of all IS modes. The NVP and IRR of each IS mode in the XF IP were greater than zero, with average values equal to 1,789.96 MRMB and 140.96 \%, respectively. The computation result for each indicator revealed that IS could lead to the use of energy with high efficiency and lighten the financial burden of enterprises in the XF IP. And the proposed index system may help IPs and EIPs to make strategic decisions when designing IS modes.},

Over the past decade, significant progress has been made towards the reduction of water consumption and improvements in effluent disposal in Kwinana. Another way to advance sustainable water use is through the realisation of regional synergies. These concern the capture, recovery and reuse of water and energy byproducts from other industries in close proximity. With up to 50 existing synergies already in place, Kwinana is recognised as a world leading example; however, more synergy opportunities appear to exist. Research is being undertaken to further develop synergies in Kwinana and also to deliver a targeted and customised toolkit.

In this article some of the central industrial symbiotic exchanges, involving water and steam, in Kalundborg are analyzed, using detailed economic and environmental data. It is found that both substantial and minor environmental benefits accrue from these industrial symbiosis exchanges and that economic motivation often is connected to upstream or downstream operational performance and not directly associated with the value of the exchanged byproduct or waste itself. It is concluded that industrial symbiosis, as viewed from a company perspective, has to be understood both in terms of individual economic and environmental performance, and as a more collective approach to industrial sustainability.},

	abstract = {Industrial symbiosis, a subfield of industrial ecology, engages traditionally separate industries and entities in a collaborative approach to resource sharing that benefits both the environment and the economy. This chapter examines the period 1989–2014 to “take stock” of industrial symbiosis. First, we look at the earliest days to discuss what inspired industrial symbiosis both in the scholarly literature and in practice. Next, we draw attention to certain dilemmas and sharpen the distinctions between industrial symbiosis and some related concepts such as eco-industrial parks and environmentally balanced industrial complexes. With regard to dissemination of industrial symbiosis ideas, we found that at the country level, China has now received the most attention in industrial symbiosis academic research and this continues to grow rapidly.

The final section looks at both theory (conceptual knowledge largely from academia) and practice (on-the-ground experience of public, not-for-profit, and private organizations working to implement industrial symbiosis) as both are essential to industrial symbiosis. A bibliometric analysis of the scholarly work, capturing 391 articles indexed in Scopus and Web of Science for 20 years between 1995 and 2014, is used to define and track the types of articles, how the mix of articles has changed over time, and what the most popular journals are. Taking a closer look at the research literature, distinct themes are identified and discussed such as the scale of industrial symbiosis, whether industrial symbiosis is based on planning or self-organization, the role of social factors, and what is known about the actual performance of industrial symbiosis. To assess important issues with regard to practice, we compile a list of industrial symbiosis-related events from database searches of reports, media, and key consulting and business organizations and examine trends, mechanisms, and motivations of industrial symbiosis practice by surveying key practitioners and academics.

Since 1989, there has been significant uptake of industrial symbiosis around the world as shown by the increasing number of journal articles and also events on the ground. Industrial symbiosis has become more geographically and institutionally diverse, as more organizations in more countries learn about the ideas and diffuse regionally specific versions. This presents additional opportunities to understand the phenomenon, but also makes the search to embrace a coherent framework more immediate.},

The approach is based on an analogy between certain objects studied by the science of ecology (ecosystems, metabolisms, symbiosis, biocenosis, etc.) and industrial systems. However, this analogical relationship raises difficulties due to the various interpretations to which it is open. Although there is agreement regarding its heuristic function, the analogy can nevertheless be understood either as a model or as a metaphor. The present article first attempts to show how models differ from metaphors. It then sets out to justify the epistemological relevance of this distinction for industrial ecology research. The reflection should thus contribute to clarifying the debate on the (supposed or desired) role of analogy in the field of industrial ecology and heighten the interest this field of investigation represents for implementing sustainable development.},

	abstract = {The increasing resource and environmental pressures have impeded China's efforts to quickly promote its people's quality of life, while protecting its natural environment. Due to lack of resources, technologies and capital, China needs to seek a more integrated development strategy. Industrial ecology (IE) may be one solution as it aims at optimizing the use of materials and energy in products, processes, industrial sectors and economies by systemically mimicking natural systems in an industrial setting. The relevant practices and experiences in the developed world have proved that there is a degree of effectiveness and efficiency to development through the application of IE. It is even more critical to apply the principles of IE in China, where resources are scarce. However, compared with developed nations, China faces different environmental, economic and social constraints. Therefore, China has to adopt different approaches to implement the concept of IE. In this paper, we first review the current practices in eco-industrial development in China. Then the advantages and barriers to applying IE in China are analyzed and recommendations are provided.

In Australia, eco-industrial parks are new and are being considered by state governments as a way of achieving more sustainable industrial development. However, for many firms, local government and communities, industrial ecology is a concept that is misunderstood and treated with suspicion. This paper uses research undertaken to investigate the application of industrial ecology to ensure more sustainable industry development in the State of Queensland, Australia, to develop a set of principles and planning guidelines for use by governments to facilitate the development of eco-industrial parks. Synergy Park, 22 km west of Brisbane, is Australia’s first planned eco-industrial park to be built. The planning and development of this eco-industrial park was a significant challenge to the developer and public agencies concerned with this project. The case study presented in this document provides useful lessons and advice for planners and developers involved with the planning and development of eco-industrial parks.},

	abstract = {A key element for achieving sustainable manufacturing systems is efficient and effective resource use. This potentially can be achieved by encouraging symbiotic thinking among multiple manufacturers and industrial actors and establish resource flow structures that are analogous to material flows in natural ecosystems. In this paper, ecological principles used by ecologists for understanding food web (FW) structures are discussed which can provide new insight for improving closed-loop manufacturing networks. Quantitative ecological metrics for measuring the performance of natural ecosystems are employed. Specifically, cyclicity, which is used by ecologists to measure the presence and strength of the internal cycling of materials and energy in a system, is discussed. To test applicability, groupings of symbiotic eco-industrial parks (EIP) were made in terms of the level of internal cycling in the network structure (high, medium, basic, and none) based on the metric cyclicity. None of the industrial systems analyzed matched the average values and amounts of cycling seen in biological ecosystems. Having detritus actors, i.e., active recyclers, is a key element for achieving more complex cycling behavior. Higher cyclicity values also correspond to higher amounts of indirect cycling and pathway proliferation rate, i.e., the rate that the number of paths increases as path length increases. In FWs, when significant cycling is present, indirect flows dominate direct flows. The application of these principles has the potential for novel insights in the context of closed-loop manufacturing systems and sustainable manufacturing.},

In this paper, Thermoeconomics, commonly used for the optimization and diagnosis of energy systems, is proposed as a tool for the characterization of Industrial Ecology. Thermoeconomics is based on the exergy analysis (Thermodynamics) but goes further by introducing the concepts of purpose and cost (Economics). It is presented in this study as a systematic and general approach for the analysis of waste flow integration. The formulation is based on extending the thermoeconomic process of the cost formation of wastes in order to consider their use as input for other processes. Consequently, it can be applied to important Industrial Ecology issues such as identification of integration possibilities and efficiency improvement, quantification of benefits obtained by integration, or determination of fair prices based on physical roots. The capability of the methodology is demonstrated by means of a case study based on the integration of a power plant, a cement kiln and a gas-fired boiler.},

The approach uses a combination of optimization and simulation tools. Assuming “top-down” overarching control of the network, we use global dynamic optimization to determine which evolutionary pathways are preferred in terms of economic, social, and environmental performance. Considering the autonomy of network entities and their actions, we apply agent-based simulation to analyze how the network actually evolves. These two perspectives are integrated into a powerful multiscale modeling framework for evaluating the consequences of new policy instruments or different business strategies aimed at stimulating sustainable development as well as identifying optimal leverage points for improved performance of the network in question. The approach is demonstrated for a regional network of interdependent organizations deploying a set of bioenergy technologies within a developing-economy context.},

	abstract = {Developing countries like India, characterized by large working populations and significantly lower cost of capital, have become hotbeds for manufacturing activities. A distinctive feature in regions of India is that majority of the industrial materi al flows are through unorganized micro, small and medium scale enterprises (MSMEs). These highly constrained MSMEs have limited resources to comply with environmental regulations because of significant investments required in pollution control measures. An important way to improve the environmental performance of these industrial clusters is to quantify, treat, and reduce industrial byproducts. This objective could be achieved through industrial symbiosis or byproduct synergy, terms used for beneficial reuse of materials or energy streams from one facility by another. In the present study an attempt has been made to identify and understand existing and potential industrial symbiosis connections in Muzaffarnagar, an industrial town in north India home to several dozen paper mills, another dozen sugar mills, and a large range of other MSME manufacturing entities.

	abstract = {This paper presents an industrial ecological insight into local waste management in Pielinen Karelia, Finland. There local system is experiencing major changes because of tightening EC waste legislation including the directives on waste incineration (2000/76/EC) and landfilling of wastes (1999/31/EC). Small local landfills are closing and most of municipal wastes will be transported 120–180 km to large-scale waste management centre in Kuopio. The paper applies three industrial ecosystem indicators, based on environmental, economic and employment impacts of different waste management technologies. Environmental indicator is CO2 equivalent emission, economic indicator is based on costs and revenues of waste management, and social (i.e. employment) indicator includes new jobs generated. The results indicate that waste incineration option in forthcoming regional cooperation could create emission savings up to 117–394 kg CO2 eqv./ton of municipal waste when compared to local landfilling. As economic impacts, new regional cooperation and long-distance transportations will increase the costs from previous 45.6–55.2 €/ton in local landfilling to 97.4 €/ton in regional landfilling and 120.8–126.9 €/ton in regional REF-III incineration. In terms of employment, the new cooperation could create 2–6.5 new jobs. The regional cooperation results to rising operational costs but avoids investments to new local infrastructure. It also creates significant emission savings, maintains current employment in waste handling and creates new jobs in long-distance transportation.},

	abstract = {In China, developing industries based on the regional resource endowment is an important approach to increase GDP in many regions in the past few decades. However, the extensive development pattern results in excessive consumption of natural resources and severe environmental pollution. Therefore, the concept of eco-industry and the theory of system engineering are combined and applied in this study. A new interactive inference method to construct industrial ecosystems is proposed. Firstly, a node information database is set up, and a material group is established according to the resource endowments in the selected region, and the construction rules are defined, such as the termination conditions. Then the structure of the ecosystem is obtained by an interactive inference process between the node information database and all possible combinations in the material group. After the supplement and elimination of nodes, an industrial ecosystem containing 34 nodes is obtained in a certain western region in China. After the industrial ecosystem constructed, a mathematical model is established to optimize the industrial ecosystem, and four aspects of objective functions, including resource efficiency, economic profit, environmental effect and comprehensive benefit, are optimized. After that, four scenarios are analyzed, and the indexes in each scenario are analyzed comparatively. Policy implications for China are proposed.},

Industrial symbiosis, a sub-field of industrial ecology, examines the flow of water, energy, materials, and by-products across firms in geographic proximity. Environmentally related co-location benefits often result that have not been a focus of traditional agglomeration economies, but extend the basic theory. This paper conceptualizes the relationship between agglomeration economies and industrial symbiosis, finding that many negative environmental externalities can be reduced while increasing production efficiency. Four industrial regions of Puerto Rico, all with agglomeration economies, but only two with significant industrial symbiosis, highlight the contribution of symbiosis and how it can influence both static and dynamic agglomeration economies.

Ein häufiges Resultat sind umweltbezogene gemeinsame Standortvorteile, die bisher nicht im Mittelpunkt der traditionellen Agglomerationswirtschaften standen, sondern die Grundtheorie erweitern.

Considering that the participating plants have their individual fuzzy cost goals and that the park authority has the objective of minimizing total freshwater consumption in the EIP, this problem may be formulated as a bi-level optimization problem, with the park authority as the upper-level decision-maker. A bi-level fuzzy optimization model is developed to explore the effect of charging fees for the purchase of freshwater and the treatment of wastewater in optimizing the water exchange network of plants in an EIP. The effect of subsidizing exchange of streams between plants is also included in the model. Results show that it is not necessary to impose exorbitant fees, nor to completely subsidize costs associated with recycling, in order to induce significant reduction of the consumption of freshwater in the EIP.},

	title = {Evaluating the success of eco-industrial development},
	abstract = {At the end of the day, a critical question for any new practice, policy or world-view is: how do you measure success? This has been a confusing question in environmental studies, where villains can become heroes and heroes villains according to choices in system boundaries and human understanding of ecological conditions. DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane), for example, is clearly harmful to flora and fauna, and yet some African nations have decided to continue its use as a deterrent for a human scourge: the spread of malaria. Nuclear power, anathema to environmental advocates, is being touted as worth a second look, in part because of the lack of greenhouse-gas emissions in this form of power generation. The analysis paralysis around even small issues—the ponderous debate summarised by the words ‘paper or plastic?’—illustrates the dearth of simple answers and the uncertainty of intuition.

Evaluation of eco-industrial developments (EIDs) has an even more complex cast. Beyond the conventional concerns of project economics and functionality, EIDs include environmental and community considerations that must also be analysed. To be successful, project benefits must outweigh the costs for each firm as well as for the development as a whole. An added responsibility for eco-industrial developers is to show that the newer form of organisation they envision is as good as or preferable to traditional ways of doing business. Tolerance for innovation comes and goes, so there is a great burden on proponents to show that, put under the analytic microscope, both in the planning stage and then in implementation, there are sound reasons and quantifiable benefits to balance the accompanying risks.},

We find that an orchestrator builds the capacity to assemble a network over time through the accumulation of resources and specialized expertise. However, as the network develops, an orchestrator faces an evolving set of dilemmas arising from the need to demonstrate value for various members and audiences. To resolve these dilemmas, orchestrators may shift their actions, moving from initially encouraging serendipitous encounters between network members (“blind dates”) to increasingly selecting members and more closely influencing their interactions (“arranging marriages”). We discuss implications of our findings for a processual understanding of orchestrated network assembly and growth.},

	abstract = {Industrial symbiosis promises environmental and economic gains through a utilization of the waste of some processes as a resource for other processes. Because of the costs and difficulties of transporting some wastes, the largest theoretical potential for industrial symbiosis is given when facilities are colocated in an eco-industrial park (EIP). This study proposes a model-centered approach with an eight-step procedure for the early planning and design of an eco-industrial park considering technical and environmental factors. Chemical process simulation software was used to model the energy and material flows among the prospective members and to quantify the benefits of integration among different firms in terms of energy and resources saved as compared to a reference situation. Process simulation was based on a combination of physical models of industrial processes and empirical models. The modeling allows for the development and evaluation of different collaboration opportunities and configurations. It also enables testing chosen configurations under hypothetical situations or external conditions. We present a case study around an existing oil and gas refinery in Mongstad, Norway. We used the approach to propose the colocation of a number of industrial facilities around the refinery, focused on integrating energy use among the facilities. An EIP with six main members was designed and simulated, matching new hypothetical members in size to the existing operations, modeling material and energy flows in the EIP, and assessing these in terms of carbon and hydrogen flows.},

The methodology is explained by demonstrating its advantages against multi-objective optimization approaches. Several formulations and solution methods for MLFG are discussed in detail. The approach is validated on a case study of water integration in EIP without and with regeneration units. In the latter, multi-leader-single-follower and single-leader-multi-follower games are studied. Each enterprise's objective is to minimize the total annualized cost, while the EIP authority objective is to minimize the consumption of freshwater within the ecopark. The MLFG is transformed into a MOPEC and solved using GAMS® as an NLP. Obtained results are compared against the MOO approach and between different MLFG formulations. The methodology proposed is proved to be very reliable in multi-criteria scenarios compared to MOO approaches, providing numerical Nash equilibrium solutions and specifically in EIP design and optimization.},

	abstract = {The emerging concept of industrial ecology (IE) has been applied in practice in few case studies on local/regional industrial recycling networks. Analogously to a natural ecosystem, the aim is to develop material cycles and energy cascades between local cooperative actors. An optimal resource basis of an industrial ecosystem is the sustainable use of local renewable natural resources. In this paper, we consider the region of North Karelia in Finland, with 19 municipalities, and hence somewhat expand the system boundaries of an industrial ecosystem case study. The current situation and two scenarios of municipal heating energy production are presented. The heating system consists of individual, district and electric heating. The heat production and related greenhouse gas emissions are considered. The current fuel use is based on imported oil and regional fuels (peat, wood wastes). Also, shares for co-production of heat and electricity (CHP) are shown. In scenario one, we assume the majority of the fuel basis in oil and absence of CHP. Scenario two illustrates nearly complete dependence on regional wood wastes and firewood with the current share of CHP. The North Karelia region provides the IE theory with a fruitful case study because the supply of waste fuels and local renewables is vast and waste utilisation technologies (CHP, fluidized bed burning) constitute a significant part of energy production. Implications of the applied scenario approach are discussed in the context of regional decision making and, in particular, for its implementation with the concepts of a regional environmental management system (EMS) and a regional industrial ecosystem management system (RIEMS).},

The research presented here was explicitly normative in its aim to improve the understanding of, and make sustainable change toward highly systemic issues of resource management. The core methods chosen to work toward this aim were bottom up action research procedures (including stakeholder engagement processes) and industrial ecology analysis tools. These methods were employed and tested in pragmatic combination through two of the author's case study projects. The first case study, performed between 2009 and 2012, employed a multi-stakeholder process aimed at improving the cycling of construction and demolition waste in the Stockholm region. The second case study produced a strategic tool (Looplocal) built for facilitating more efficient regional industrial resource networks. While the highly participative aim of the cases required a larger contribution of resources than that of more closed studies, it is arguable that the efficacy of approaching the project aims is improved through their employment.},

Such stakeholders distributed widely in the region often play essential roles on environmental problem, so they are required to be embedded in Eco town. Eco town has to supply substantial information to suffice them. In this paper, we propose an environmental management system for Eco town. It comprises two parts, material flow analysis (MFA) and database. MFA reveals some characteristic indicators, such as resource consumption, production and waste discharge. We combine these indicators and offer new indicators to comprehend current situation. The database includes recycle technology and waste discharge. Companies who want to treat their own waste refer the database to look for adequate treatment method. Companies who want to begin recycle business refer detail of targeted waste for marketing. By supplying such information, we can help to bridge between demand and supply. We also show application this system to Eco town in Aichi prefecture, Japan.},

	abstract = {Integrated energy systems (IES) such as polygeneration plants and bioenergy-based industrial symbiosis (BBIS) networks offer the prospect of increased efficiency and reduced carbon emissions. However, these highly-integrated systems are also characterized by the strong interdependence among component units. This interdependency results in the risk of propagation of cascading failures within such networks, where disturbances in the operation of one component results in ripple effects that affect the other units in the system. In this work, a novel criticality index is proposed to quantify the effects of a component unit’s failure to run at full capacity within an IES. This index is defined as the ratio of the fractional change in the net output to the fractional change in capacity of the component causing the failure. The component units in the entire system can then be ranked based on this index. Such risk-based information can thus be used as an important input for developing risk mitigation measures and policies. Without this information, risk management based only on network topology could result to counterintuitive results. A simple polygeneration plant and two BBIS case studies are presented to demonstrate the computation of the criticality index.},

The definition reflected the state of research and practice at the time; as both have advanced, some terms have been interpreted in substantially different ways. In this article we analyze those generally used terms for their connection to the ecological metaphor that is the root of industrial ecology, and their varied interpretations in IS research and practice over time. We then propose an updated definition intended to communicate the essence of IS as a tool for innovative green growth: IS engages diverse organizations in a network to foster eco-innovation and long-term culture change. Creating and sharing knowledge through the network yields mutually profitable transactions for novel sourcing of required inputs and value-added destinations for non-product outputs, as well as improved business and technical processes. We posit that, although geographic proximity is often associated with IS, it is neither necessary nor sufficient—nor is a singular focus on physical resource exchange.},

	abstract = {As the basic unit for eco-city development, industrial park significantly contributes to the national environment protection and eco-civilization. This paper established an emergy-based evaluation framework, simulating the emergy storage and flows, to identify the input-output of the high-end industrial park. The emergy-based indicator system of the industrial park is also set up, including structural indices and functional indices, so as to assess the environmental impacts of the industrial park on the surrounding ecosystems. The results show that the sustainability of local environment is not optimistic due to the large amount of emergy input from outside imposed on surrounding environment of the industrial park. Full of central, technical and service industries, the high-end industrial park has lower materials demand compared to the traditional parks. The major emergy inputs cover materials, energy, labor, of which labor and service emergy contribute almost 90\%, fitting well with the characteristics of highly-concentrated sci-tech talents and headquarter role of the park. The high-end industrial park has a higher level of emergy density and per capita emergy, indicating a high level of regional development and emergy hierarchy. Although there are concentrated emergy flows, the emergy yield ratio is lower than 100\%, implying the park has the potential to develop rapidly due to the emergy surplus.},

Focus is given to the management of water among multiple processes in a common EIP facility. Recycle, reuse, and separation using interception devices are considered as possible strategies for managing wastewater. A source-interception-sink structural representation is used to embed potential configurations of interest. The representation accounts for the possibilities of direct recycle, material (waste) exchange, mixing and segregation of different streams, separation and treatment in interception units, and allocation to process users (sinks). Then, the EIP design problem is formulated as an optimization program whose objective is to minimize cost of the EIP while determining optimal recycle and separation strategies. A case study is solved to illustrate the applicability of the devised approach. © 2009 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 2009},

	abstract = {Closing loops by intercompany recycling of by-products is a core theme of industrial ecology (IE). This article considers whether industrial recycling networks or industrial symbiosis projects can be used as a starting point for much broader intercompany cooperation for sustainable development. Evidence presented is based on the results of an empirical investigation of the recycling network Styria in Austria, the recycling network Oldenburger Münsterland in Germany, and the manufacturing sector in Austria. Statistical analysis shows that the percentage of by-products that are passed on to other companies for recycling purposes is not higher in member companies of the recycling networks than in the other companies of the manufacturing sector in Austria. In terms of cooperation, the relationships with the respective recycling partners are found to be very similar to regular customer relations. Furthermore, the companies of the recycling networks remain unaware of the network to which they belong. Instead, one of the main findings of this study is that intercompany recycling activities are regarded by the company representatives as bilateral market transactions, not as collaborative network activities. This has potentially significant implications for the use of industrial symbiosis networks as starting points for sustainability networks with broader cooperation toward sustainability. The findings raise interesting questions as to whether such broader cooperation might result from a conscious planning process or might emerge largely spontaneously as part of normal market coordination. In any case, intercompany recycling is clearly considered to be a very important field of collaborative action for sustainability in industry.},

This article provides a historical view of the motivations and means for pursuing industrial symbiosis—defined to include physical exchanges of materials, energy, water, and by-products among diversified clusters of firms. It finds that “uncovering” existing symbioses has led to more sustainable industrial development than attempts to design and build eco-industrial parks incorporating physical exchanges. By examining 15 proposed projects brought to national and international attention by the U.S. President's Council on Sustainable Development beginning in the early 1990s, and contrasting these with another 12 projects observed to share more elements of self-organization, recommendations are offered to stimulate the identification and uncovering of already existing “kernels” of symbiosis. In addition, policies and practices are suggested to identify early-stage precursors of potentially larger symbioses that can be nurtured and developed further. The article concludes that environmentally and economically desirable symbiotic exchanges are all around us and now we must shift our gaze to find and foster them.},

	abstract = {By ‘working with the willing', the National Industrial Symbiosis Programme (NISP) has successfully facilitated industrial symbiosis throughout the United Kingdom and, in the process, delivered significant economic and environmental benefits for both Programme members and the country as a whole. One of the keys to NISP's success is that, unlike failed attempts to plan and construct eco-industrial systems from scratch, the Programme works largely with existing companies who have already settled in, developed, and successfully operate within a given locale. This article argues that existing and mature industrial systems provide the best prospects for identifying opportunities for, and ultimately facilitating, industrial symbiosis. Due to levels of diversification and operational fundamental niches that, in the fullness of time, develop within all industrial systems, industrially mature areas are deemed to be industrial symbiosis ‘conducive environments'. Building on the conservation biology concept of a habitat suitability index, the article presents a methodology for comparing a potential site for eco-industrial development to a known baseline industrial ‘habitat' already identified as being highly conducive to industrial symbiosis. The suitability index methodology is further developed and applied to a multi-criteria evaluation geographic information system to produce a ‘habitat' suitability map that allows practitioners to quickly identify potential industrial symbiosis hotspots (the methodology is illustrated for England). The article concludes by providing options for the development of symbiosis suitability indices and how they can be used to support the facilitation of industrial symbiosis and regional resource efficiency.},

An EIPWNS is synthesized, designed, and compared to a conventional water system (CWS). The feasibility study using life cycle assessment and life cycle costing shows that the total environmental impacts of the EIPWNS are 7.5\% to 16.0\% less than those of the CWS, and the life cycle cost of the EIPWNS is 15.6\% less. Therefore, the EIPWNS can be employed in remodeling a conventional industrial park to an eco-industrial park. This study provides a good example for disseminating EIPWNSs.},

This model, formally accepted in 2002 and termed the 'circular economy', is understood to mean the realisation of a closed loop of material flows in the Chinese economic system. Successful implementation of this model is seen as one way in which China can 'leapfrog' past environmental damage that is typically seen as economies industrialise. This paper introduces the development of the model in China, and presents the current situation of circular economy practice in China. The paper describes current measures being implemented in China for the long-term promotion of a circular economy, including the formulation of objectives, legislation, policies and measures, so that the country can 'leapfrog' its way from environmentally-damaging development to a more sustainable path. The paper then identifies a series of barriers and challenges to the implementation of the concept in China. Finally, conclusions on the future of the circular economy concept are drawn. Data were derived primarily from an analysis of secondary sources (i.e. previously published papers). Additional primary data derived from the main author's personal involvement in several circular economy initiatives were also employed.},

	abstract = {Industrial facilities impacting a watershed may be clustered into groups based on their geographical locations. Water usage and discharge for each clustered group of industries may be integrated through the introduction of an eco-industrial park (EIP). This paper presents a mathematical programming model for water integration of EIPs to be synthesized with the purpose of mitigating the environmental impact of industrial effluents discharged into watersheds. The model considers the creation of multiple EIPs, their location, sizing, and tasks. To determine the effect of the discharges on the surrounding watershed, a material flow analysis (MFA) model was coupled with water recycle strategies within the industrial facilities and the associated EIPs. The MFA characterizes the interaction of individual discharges and tracks the impact of the natural (physical, chemical, and biological) phenomena within the watershed on the fate and transport of pollutants. A multiobjective optimization formulation is developed to guide the decisions for multiplant water integration while accounting for the impact on the watershed. The objective function reconciles the minimization of the environmental impact on the watershed, the minimization of the total annualized cost of the water-management system, which includes the cost of fresh water, effluent treatment, and piping and pumping associated with the eco-industrial parks. An example is presented to show the scope and capabilities of the proposed optimization approach.},

In this article, the nascent industrial symbiosis network in Guayama, Puerto Rico, is explored from environmental, economic, and regulatory perspectives of the individual participants and the community. A coal-fired power plant, owned and operated by the AES Corporation, draws five million gallons per day of process water from nearby sources thus avoiding freshwater withdrawals and, through steam sales, significantly reduces emissions from a nearby refinery. This article quantifies economic and environmental costs and benefits for the symbiosis participants, concluding that there are substantial benefits to engaging in symbiosis, although these benefits fall unevenly on participating organizations. Policy intervention can be a viable means of motivating more regular occurrences of resource exchanges among groups of firms.},

This paper reviews the stakeholders' understanding of EIPs. Furthermore, research was conducted on the barriers to the actual promotion of the project in South Korea. First, stakeholders' understanding of EIPs is identified as being self-interested. The need for EIPs is mostly found in responding to civil complaints and pollutants resulting from the industrial park. However, the need is quite different from the original intention of EIPs. As a result, the project unsuccessfully deals with the needs of the stakeholders because of technical, economic, and social obstacles. Second, support from the public sector for the project seems quite inadequate. The public sector appears to lack the proper policy means and will to actualize the project. In conclusion, the Korean government needs to participate more actively in the project than it currently is doing. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.},

We simulated and evaluated a redesigned eco-industrial system in Changchun Economic and Technological Development Zone (CCETDZ) in the present work using system dynamics and grey cluster methods. Four typical development strategies were simulated during 2005–2020 via standard system dynamic models. Furthermore, analytic hierarchy process and grey cluster allowed for the eco-industrial system evaluation and scenarios optimizing. Our dynamic simulation and statistical analysis revealed that: (1) CCETDZ would have different development scenarios under different strategies. The total population in scenario 2 grew most rapidly and reached 3.28 × 105 in 2020, exceeding its long-term planning expected population. And the GDP differences among these four scenarios would amount to 6.41 × 1010 RMB. On the other hand, environmental pollution would become serious along with economy increasing. As a restriction factor, positive or negative increment of water resource will occur according to the selected strategy. (2) The fourth strategy would have the best efficiency, which means that the most efficiently development of CCETDZ required to take science, technology, environment progress and economy increase into account at the same time. (3) Positive environment protection measures, such as cleaner production, green manufacture, production life cycle management and environment friendly industries, should be attached great importance the same as economy development during 2005–2020 in CCETDZ.},

As such, the tool kit of complex systems science could enrich our understanding of how industrial ecosystems might evolve over time. In this article, I illustrate how an important tool of complex systems science—agent-based simulation—can help to identify those potential elements of an industrial ecosystem that could work together to achieve more eco-efficient outcomes. For example, I show how agent-based simulation can generate cost-efficient energy futures in which groups of firms behave more eco-efficiently by introducing strategically located clusters of renewable, low-emissions, distributed generation. I then explain how role-playing games and participatory modeling can build trust and reduce conflict about the sharing of common-pool resources such as water and energy among small clusters of evolving agents. Collective learning can encourage potential industrial partners to gradually cooperate by exchanging by-products and/or sharing common infrastructure by dint of their close proximity. This kind of coevolutionary learning, aided by participatory modeling, could help to bring about industrial symbiosis.},

Industrial symbiosis engages traditionally separate industries in a collective approach to competitive advantage involving physical exchange of materials, energy, water, and/or by-products. The keys to industrial symbiosis are collaboration and the synergistic possibilities offered by geographic proximity. This paper reviews the small industrial symbiosis literature and some antecedents, as well as early efforts to develop eco-industrial parks as concrete realizations of the industrial symbiosis concept. Review of the projects is organized around a taxonomy of five different material exchange types. Input-output matching, stakeholder processes, and materials budgeting appear to be useful tools in advancing eco-industrial park development. Evolutionary approaches to industrial symbosis are found to be important in creating the level of cooperation needed for multi-party exchanges.},

The famous ‘industrial symbiosis’ that formed in and around the Danish city of Kalundborg and other similar cases in other parts of Europe and North America are taken as a point of departure. These recycling linkages were found to be primarily the result of the entrepreneurial actions that aimed to create value out of by-products and/or to reduce production costs through the adoption of new inputs. As the incentives driving this behaviour are not new, this paper contends that ‘industrial symbiosis’ is not, as is usually believed, a break with past practices, but rather a widespread phenomenon that has been neglected by contemporary researchers. Historical evidence is provided to support this claim. It is argued that while significant inter-firm recycling linkages will spontaneously emerge at the regional level, these should not be forced at the expense of inter-regional linkages.},

The particularly interesting feature of this case study is the use of a CEMS (in this case, ISO 14001) by the administrative group of the DETDZ to develop a more comprehensive approach to the wide range of environmental issues that they face in running the zone. In essence the goal is to address many of the issues at the level of the zone. The incentives, benefits, and barriers associated with implementing ISO 14001 are described. However, implementation of an EMS should not be thought of as the ultimate objective for an industrial park’s environmental management. The next steps include encouraging further public participation and taking an integrated approach leading to an industrial ecosystem, which can realize better environmental performance at the industrial park level.},

This involves businesses in close proximity exchanging by-product material, water and energy. Utilisation of a previously discarded resource as an alternative input to another company can help improve both business and sustainability performance of the participating companies. For example, the exchange can reduce disposal costs and provide a cheaper input for the receiving company. The environmental benefits can include reduced collective resource consumption and waste generation, whilst the social benefits may include new employment opportunities and reduction of emission (e.g. water or traffic) to the local community.
This article presents the integrated research programme undertaken at the Centre of Excellence in Cleaner Production, Curtin University of Technology which seeks to enhance the uptake of industrial symbiosis in Australian heavy industrial areas.

A typology of five main research questions is proposed: (1) analysis, (2) improvement, and (3) expansion of existing systems; (4) design of new eco-industrial parks, and (5) restructuring of circular economies. The LCA guidelines were found useful in framing the question and choosing an appropriate reference case for comparison. The selection of a correct reference case reduces the risk of overestimating the benefits of by-product exchange. In the analysis of existing systems, environmentally extended input-output analysis (EEIOA) can be used to streamline the analysis and provide an industry average baseline for comparison. However, when large-scale changes are applied to the system, more sophisticated tools are necessary for assessment of the consequences, from market analysis to general equilibrium modeling and future scenario work. Such a rigorous application of systems analysis was not found in the current IS literature, but would benefit the field substantially, especially when the environmental impact of large-scale economic changes is analyzed.},

	abstract = {Industrial ecology (IE) is a scientific field related to the exchanges between the natural and industrial ecosystem with the aim of creating a more sustainable society. A way to use the concept of IE in practice is the concept of Industrial symbiosis (IS), which is a method to create an industrial ecosystem similar to the natural one. The aim of this master thesis work was to analyze various approaches to initiating industrial symbiosis within the context of Sweden. One approach took a national scope where the goal was to identify different regions suitable for industrial symbiosis; meanwhile a second approach was on a regional or local level where the different energy and material flows between companies in a region were analyzed. The overall purpose of the project was to increase the resource (material, energy and other) cycling within Swedish regions. The two approaches are quite different and was therefore divided into two separate projects, presented separately in this paper and then followed by a general discussion and conclusion about the whole work and IS in general. The first project consisted of connecting industrial processes with LCI data and waste statistics in order to uncover different energy and material flows between companies located in Sweden. Meanwhile the second project was based on a more traditional way of collecting data, where a large amount of companies where invited to a synergy discovering workshop. The methodology used in the first project worked well where regions with high potentials for industrial material recycling such as Helsingborg were identified. However, the method is strongly dependent on the allocation of LCI process data, and poor information can lead to overly aggregated material flow information. During the work with the second (networking) project it became clear that companies were interested in energy and material flows, but they had not thought about the optimization of such as IS earlier. The utilization of workshops was regarded as a good method for gathering a large amount of information efficiently. However, the energy required coordinating and the difficulty in gaining a broad attendance to such events is a large drawback. Industrial symbiosis is a working concept in United Kingdom (UK), of which National Industrial Symbiosis Programme is a good example of, but it could be difficult to implement the same working methods in Sweden due to the different driving forces regarding waste. For example, various regulative measures and market prices that brings Sweden to landfill much less than the UK at this point. In the local workshop, it was realized that the municipality of Sigtuna was not a prone region for performing specific cost benefit analysis (CBA) or material flow accounting (MFA) regarding the possibilities for IS.},

	abstract = {The application of ecological concepts to the industrial setting has been touched upon by literature across several disciplines. Two emerging ecological planning approaches, landscape ecology and industrial ecology, are applied here to look at alternative ways of planning industrial parks. As an emerging field, landscape ecology provides different viewpoints from the traditional approach of natural conservation, which mainly focuses on the protection of nature. The approach of landscape ecology regards the environment as a land mosaic, a mixture of natural and urban environment, which concerns a manageable human-scale environment across one or two human generations. Industrial ecology, on the other hand, goes beyond the traditional “end of pipe” idea of pollution control and learns from the ecosystem concept. The current paper is an attempt to reconcile these two fields as an integrated approach to the planning of industrial areas. Using a case study of Singapore’s Jurong Island industrial park, two fundamental issues behind the idea of landscape ecology and industrial ecology are raised. If raw materials, energy and by-products are more easily replaced or reused by technology and management, then research on industrial ecology and related knowledge will be crucial for developing natural resource substitution by innovative technology and new ways of environmental management. Where it is difficult to substitute natural resources, the skills of planning and managing natural resources will take priority over other strategies. In this situation, the knowledge of landscape ecology needs to be applied to the prediction, design and evaluation of ecologically optimum resource uses, patterns and processes in the mixture of natural, urban and industrial environment. A new concept, “nurtured landscape”, is proposed for mediating between the natural ecosystem and the urban/industrial environment. The nurtured landscape provides a basis for the development of new ecological technology using landscape to ameliorate the polluting effects of the urban/industrial neighbourhood. The planning of Singapore’s Jurong Island industrial park provides a test of applying the principles of landscape ecology and industrial ecology to the possible transformation of an industrial area.},

	abstract = {Industrial symbiosis (IS) has been identified as a strategy for promoting industrial sustainability. IS has been defined as the development of close working agreements between industrial and other organizations that, through the innovative reuse, recycling, or sharing of resources, leads to resource efficiency. Key to IS are innovation and social network development. This article critically reviews IS literature and concludes that, to inform proactive strategies for promoting IS, the understanding of the social processes leading to resource innovation needs to be improved. Industrial ecologists generally believe that close geographical proximity and trust are essential to the development of IS. This article argues, however, that there is a need to learn more about the meaning of, need for, and specific role of geographical proximity and trust in IS and, additionally, that other potentially important social factors have remained underexplored. To move IS research forward, this article suggests to engage with research in economic geography on the concept of ‘proximity,’ which draws attention to the ways in which geographical, cognitive, institutional, social, and organizational distances between actors might affect innovation. Arguably, the analytically distinct, but flexible, dimensions of proximity can be useful to explore how and why IS develops. The resulting qualitative knowledge would form a basis for researching whether general patterns for IS development exist and, more important, could inform public and private strategies that indicate which actions could be taken, as well as when and in what way to promote resource synergies and sustainable industrial development.},

	abstract = {A circular economy refers to an industrial economy with a cradle to cradle vision, shifting from the use of fossil fuels towards renewable energy, minimizing the use of toxic chemicals and reducing waste by recycling through careful system design. The concept of a circular economy is based on the study of non-linear, in particular living systems, with a major outcome being the optimisation of systems rather than of the individual components which make up each system. Industrial symbiosis (IS) is the exchange of energy, waste and by-products among industries in order to add value, while reducing costs and environmental impacts. This is consistent with the principles of a circular economy, and is a stepping stone towards the design of sustainable economies and policies. In the scope of this study, the use of local and renewable resources and the development of industrial ecology can contribute to the decrease of environmental impacts of a living, interactive system, on a given territory. A process system design framework is developped to model a superstructure that contains the list of possible options for the system. The LCA is used to calculate the environmental impacts of a product or a service. The method requires certain adjustments in order to assess the impacts of a spatially delimited system. The design of such system can be done by combining Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) that can provide a clear and structured framework to assess the environmental impacts of the system and process system design methods that applies mathematical programing techniques to systematically design territorial configurations using costs and thermo-chemical or physical models. The new method allows to generate the most attractive scenarios for the systems using a systematic modeling framework and using an optimisation approach that allows to generate a limited set of pareto optimal configurations that can then be evaluated to identify the most attractive solution. The method has been successsfully applied on a case study of a city with 100,000 inhabitants.},

	abstract = {Most chemical companies consume a lot of steam, water and electrical resources in the production process. Given recent record fuel costs, utility networks must be optimized to reduce the overall cost of production. Environmental concerns must also be considered when preparing modifications to satisfy the requirements for industrial utilities, since wastes discharged from the utility networks are restricted by environmental regulations. Construction of Eco-Industrial Parks (EIPs) has drawn attention as a promising approach for retrofitting existing industrial parks to improve energy efficiency. The optimization of the utility network within an industrial complex is one of the most important undertakings to minimize energy consumption and waste loads in the EIP.

In this work, a systematic approach to optimize the utility network of an industrial complex is presented. An important issue in the optimization of a utility network is the desire of the companies to achieve high profits while complying with the environmental regulations. Therefore, the proposed optimization was performed with consideration of both economic and environmental factors.

The proposed approach consists of unit modeling using thermodynamic principles, mass and energy balances, development of a multi-period Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model for the integration of utility systems in an industrial complex, and an economic/environmental analysis of the results. This approach is applied to the Yeosu Industrial Complex, considering seasonal utility demands. The results show that both the total utility cost and waste load are reduced by optimizing the utility network of an industrial complex.},

In particular, the role of a municipality in developing regional industrial ecology, and, vice versa, the role of regional industrial ecology in developing MEM, will be reflected upon. It is argued that a municipality, serving as an institutional anchor tenant, may provide the regional IE effort with the needed institutional support. In return, regional IE seems to have the potential to provide a basis for increased co-operation between public and private actors of a region as well as integration of regional environmental and development issues.

The implementation of eco-industrial parks may significantly contribute to the creation of a sustainable economy. Despite this prospect, the actual development of eco-industrial parks is challenging, as a variety of factors must be considered. Not only technical, economic, and environmental factors are relevant but numerous stakeholder relationships as well, such as between firms, governmental bodies, and local communities. This paper presents a conceptual framework that is used to capture these diverse aspects and the relationships between them. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is used for modeling its concepts and relationships. First, based on a literature survey, relevant concepts of eco-industrial parks are identified. One central concept is “industrial symbiosis”. A novel value-based interpretation of industrial symbiosis is presented. Second, the park’s economic, local and regional development context, as well as its internal technical components and their relationships are modeled. Finally, the framework is used for modeling a concrete eco-industrial park, in this case part of the Kalundborg eco-industrial park.},

We discuss methodological studies from the perspective of individual industrial metabolic processes and network analysis. Analyzing specific metabolic processes can help to characterize the exchanges of materials and energy, and to reveal the ecological performance and economic benefits of the symbiosis. Network analysis methods are increasingly being used to analyze both the structural and functional characteristics of a system.

Local co-operation in industrial symbioses can reduce raw material use and waste disposal, but material and energy flows extending outside symbiosis boundaries can cause considerable environmental impacts. These external impacts are often ignored in industrial symbiosis studies. In this study, we compared process, hybrid and input−output life cycle assessment (LCA) approaches in quantifying the overall environmental impacts of a forest industrial symbiosis, situated in Kymenlaakso, Finland. Conclusions from an earlier process-LCA were strengthened by the use of hybrid-LCA as local emissions were found to cause less than half of the global impacts. In some impact categories, the whole impact was caused by supply chain emissions (land use, metal depletion and ozone depletion). The cutoff in process-LCA was found to be less than 25\%, except in metal depletion and terrestrial ecotoxicity. Input−output LCA approximated hybrid-LCA results well in most impact categories, but seriously underestimated land use and overestimated terrestrial ecotoxicity. Based on the results we conclude, that input−output based LCA can be used to analyze the global impacts of an industrial symbiosis, but a careful interpretation of the results is necessary in order to understand the influence of aggregation and allocation.},

EIPs are based upon industrial ecology principles that suggest industrial systems can operate in a similar fashion to natural ecological systems. Drawing upon a survey of all identifiable EIPs in the USA and Europe and in-depth interview surveys of 16 EIPs, the research discovered few examples of networking between firms or processes using wastes and materials recycling. Most EIPs are at a very early stage of development, where linkages are potential rather than real. The problems encountered in developing EIPs from scratch suggests that a more fruitful approach is to build upon existing and potential linkages within a locality, assisted by a pro-active policy to encourage interchanges.},

This article is based on a social science approach, ranging from organisational learning to the analysis of industrial districts, in reflection to the techno-economic approach of the developments in the industrial ecology projects ‘INES 1994–1997 and INES Mainport 1999–2002’ in the Rotterdam harbour and industry complex. In relation to the growing attention for regional types of industrial ecology, the article aims to provide a useful social science analytical framework for investigating regional industrial ecology, and to develop a prescriptive approach that can stimulate such industrial ecology. Regional industrial ecological systems meet with static and dynamic issues as a result of specific system boundaries of their decision-making levels. The analytical framework provides insight into these issues through a focus on three phases of (regional) industrial ecology, the production of collective goods, and governance mechanisms. We find that the INES Mainport project is still in the first phase of industrial ecology. To go beyond this phase, the Rotterdam harbour and industry region faces the limits of system boundaries of the decision-making levels within the regional management.},

In this article we analyze those generally used terms for their connection to the ecological metaphor that is the root of industrial ecology, and their varied interpretations in IS research and practice over time. We then propose an updated definition intended to communicate the essence of IS as a tool for innovative green growth: IS engages diverse organizations in a network to foster eco-innovation and long-term culture change. Creating and sharing knowledge through the network yields mutually profitable transactions for novel sourcing of required inputs and value-added destinations for non-product outputs, as well as improved business and technical processes.We posit that, although geographic proximity is often associated with IS, it is neither necessary nor sufficientnor is a singular focus on physical resource exchange},

Nonhazardous industrial waste is a high volume flow principally constituted of wastewater with some solid materials. The state of Pennsylvania produced some 20 million metric tons of these residual wastes in 2004. An innovative reporting requirement for industrial generators implemented and compiled by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection has resulted in a rich database collected since 1992 of residual waste generation, detailing the fate of more than 100 materials. By combining these records with life cycle inventory (LCI) data, the current and potential environmental benefits of residual waste use have been assessed. Results for Pennsylvania indicate a savings in 2004 of 13 PJ of primary energy, 0.9 million metric tons of CO2eq, 4300 tons of SO2eq, and 4200 tons of NOx emissions from reuse of residual wastes. While these energy savings constitute less than 1\% of total industrial primary energy use in the state, it is a greater quantity of energy than that generated by the state’s renewable energy sector. The framework and constraints surrounding reuse of residual waste in Pennsylvania are discussed.},

Individual and haphazard attempts to increase linkages among co-located firms have been complemented by concerted efforts to stimulate the development of industrial regions with intensified resource exchanges that reduce environmental impact. Additionally, there are examples of both spontaneous and facilitated linkages between two or more firms involving flows of materials/energy waste. A striking feature of IS activities is that they are found across diverse social contexts and vary considerably in form (Lombardi et al., 2012); there are substantial differences in the ways in which IS manifests itself. Equally diverse are the activities of policy makers to stimulate such linkages. Such diversity can already be found within Europe, as became apparent in a first meeting among some of the present authors in 2009 (Isenmann and Chernykh, 2009). Researchers present there decided to create a network of European researchers on IS, with the explicit aim to develop a comparative analysis. We can thus provide insight to the relationship between the style of IS and its context and thereby the potential for policy makers in different contexts to learn from each other. Policy learning can be a tempting route to IS, but is fraught with difficulties if the influence of context is not appreciated (e.g., Wang et al., Chapter 6, this volume).},

Preliminary support for the model is found in existing databases and in the literature. Some potential problems and model qualifications are highlighted. The model is then used to examine regional decline and sustainable industrial regeneration in the South Yorkshire region of the UK.

Very few such materials are reconstituted and applied in new products at the same material inherent quality level as in their first lifetime – a process known as “closed-loop recycling”. In general, industrial society maintains an extract, expend, expel modus operandi despite demonstrated “loop closure” feasibility for a significant number of materials. This thesis builds from a foundation in Industrial Ecology, a field prescribing to an ecological metaphor for how paradigmatic change might take place towards closure of material-energy cycles. It utilises three detailed case studies of loop closure work to develop a conceptual framework describing behaviour of industrial actors when faced with the opportunity, or need, to innovate for material cycle closure. This work helps answer questions about why work towards closure for “promising” material cycles may not be progressing, where key barriers lie, and how measures might be implemented to encourage the evolution of industrial conduct towards more widespread closed-loop recycling.},

Because of their rapid proliferation and the lack of accepted and common characteristics, the performance of these projects has been difficult to evaluate.

This paper aims to explore the applicability and feasibility of the selected indicators. First, it presents the details of this new standard. Second, the feasibility of the new standard is explored by applying the indicators to two industrial zones in China. The benefits and challenges faced in applying the indicators are then discussed in relation to the literature. The analysis demonstrates that the new indicators have a fairly narrow focus on eco-efficiency, rather than a broad objective of ecologically sustainable industrial development. Nevertheless, the Chinese standard is a useful beginning. In future, the authors suggest that this set of indicators be revised to add ecological dimensions that will help promote more sustainable development of industrial parks.},

Besides its name and a number of borrowed concepts, however, industrial ecology has no formal relationship with the ecological sciences. This study explores the potential for further interdisciplinary collaboration by testing whether some of the same quantitative analysis techniques used in community ecology research can have meaning in an industrial context. Specifically, we applied the ecological concepts of connectance and diversity to an analysis of Burnside Industrial Park in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Our results demonstrate that these ecological tools show promise for use in industrial ecology. We discuss the meaning of connectance and diversity concepts in an industrial context and suggest next steps for future studies. We hope that this research will help to lay the groundwork of an ecologically inspired tool kit for analyzing industrial ecosystems.},

This paper discusses the notion of entropy and the relationship of entropy to environmental management of industrial activities. In the paper, two case studies of Eco-Industrial Networks are presented: the case of aluminium and that of copper. The analysis of case studies made clear, firstly, that the production of aluminium or copper by recycling new scrap generates significantly less specific entropy than the production of the same product from primary raw materials and, secondly, that the effort of closing the loops of material flows aiming at complete recycling leads to higher generation of specific entropy than those which correspond to the use of primary raw materials. It is proven that there exists an entropy limit of environmental effectiveness when recycling each product. The present paper comments on this limit.},

This article provides an overview of past and current synergy developments in two of Australia's major heavy industrial regions, Kwinana (Western Australia) and Gladstone (Queensland), and includes a comparative review and assessment of the drivers, barriers, and trigger events for regional synergies initiatives in both areas. Kwinana and Gladstone compare favorably with well-known international examples in terms of the current level and maturity of industry involvement and collaboration and the commitment to further explore regional resource synergies. Kwinana stands out with regard to the number, diversity, complexity, and maturity of existing synergies. Gladstone is remarkable with regard to unusually large geographic boundaries and high dominance of one industry sector. Many diverse regional synergy opportunities still appear to exist in both industrial regions (particularly in Kwinana), mostly in three broad areas: water, energy, and inorganic by-product reuse. To enhance the further development of new regional synergies, the Centre for Sustainable Resource Processing (CSRP), a joint initiative of Australian minerals processing companies, research providers, and government agencies, has undertaken several collaborative projects. These include research to facilitate the process of identifying and evaluating potential synergy opportunities and assistance for the industries with feasibility studies and implementation of selected synergy projects in both regions. The article also reports on the progress to date from this CSRP research.},

This strategy expands the application of CE from individual enterprises to eco-industrial parks (EIPs) and to the cities, provinces, and regions. We carried out field studies in three EIPs in Baotou, Suzhou, and Shanghai. In this paper, we discuss the current state of CE and the sustainable development of EIPs in China. We first provide detailed information on the three EIPs' infrastructures, preferential policies, CE frameworks, and eco-chains. We then examine the status of sustainable development in the three EIPs from the perspectives of socio-economic, resource and material efficiency, and environmental performance. The results indicate that the overall performance of the three EIPs is reasonably good with respect to socio-economics, resources and materials, and efficiency and environmental protection, whereas green management is rather weak and thus requires further improvement. We found that the CE frameworks along with eco-chains within the EIPs are effectively improving resource and material efficiency. Moreover, we demonstrate that there are positive associations among socio-economic, resource and material, and environmental indicators. Given the large presence of EIPs in the local economies, these results suggest that EIPs play a key role in promoting sustainable development in China.},

This strategy has generated new revenues and reduced environmental emissions and disposal costs, while simultaneously improving the quality of sugar. Internally, the GG's complex consists of interlinked production of sugar, alcohol, cement, compound fertilizer, and paper and includes recycling and reuse. Externally, the GG has established a strong customer base as a result of its product quality, has worked to maintain and expand its supply base through technological and economic incentives to farmers (and even to competitors), and has had to react to a strong government presence that fundamentally affects its operations. Operations to date support some of the fundamental concepts of industrial symbiosis.

This article challenges the dominant negative perspective by discussing by-product development in one of the most market-oriented societies in human history, Victorian England. Building on nineteenth and early twentieth century writings on the topic, as well as a more detailed analysis of the development of valuable by-products from highly problematic iron and coal gas production residuals, a case is made that the search for increased profitability within the context of private property rights often simultaneously promoted economic and environmental progress in the long run, as well as on different geographical scales.},

	abstract = {Purpose
– The purpose of this paper is to review and update Devens eco-industrial park sustainability indicators and benchmark progress made since 2000 in the seven key areas of its sustainability vision.

Design/methodology/approach
– The authors examined publicly available data for Devens, Massachusetts, and obtained additional data from Devens Enterprise Commission and a survey of 29 local organizations.

Findings
– Of the 43 indicators adopted by Devens eco-industrial park in 2012, 29 demonstrate progress, seven show lack of progress, six point to a potential progress, and for one no information was available in 2000 to evaluate progress. Most progress has been made in the areas of transportation, business and economic sustainability, governance and natural resources.

Research limitations/implications
– For some proposed indicators no data were available to evaluate progress (e.g. waste generation, recycling, compositing, and landfill diversion) yet these are among the key measures for an eco-industrial park.

Practical implications
– Proposed framework, indicators and lessons learned are of value for researchers and practitioners at other eco-industrial parks (EIPs) interested in benchmarking progress toward sustainable local development.

Social implications
– The case provides insights on integrating sustainability in local economic development.

Originality/value
– The study is paving the way toward development of a standardized set of sustainability indicators for EIPs in the USA.},

	abstract = {Rapidly industrializing Asian countries (RIACs) face both development and environmental challenges. The increasing resource and environmental pressures have impeded RIACs' efforts to quickly promote their people's quality of life, while protecting their natural environment. Due to lack of resources, technologies and capital, RIACs need to seek a more integrated development strategy. Industrial ecology may be one solution, as it aims at optimizing the use of materials and energy in products, processes, industrial sectors and economies by systemically mimicking natural systems in an industrial setting. The relevant practices and experiences in the developed world have proved that there is a degree of effectiveness and efficiency to development through the application of industrial ecology. It is even more critical to applying the principles of industrial ecology in RIACs with fewer resources. However, compared with the developed nations, RIACs face different environmental, economic and social constraints. Therefore, RIACs have to adopt different approaches to implement the concept of industrial ecology. In this paper, we first introduce the environmental, economic and social constraints in RIACs and imply that RIACs need a sustainable industrial development strategy, namely, ‘producing more with less’. Then, we review the current practices on eco-industrial development in RIACs. As a specific case study, due to its size and increasing influence on the global economy and politics, China will be examined in detail with regard to its eco-industrial development practices. Through these approaches, the challenges to applying industrial ecology to RIACs will be analyzed and recommendations are provided.},

	abstract = {Industrial ecology and the industrial ecosystem approach (IE) are emerging concepts in ecological economics, environmental policy and corporate environmental management. The natural ecosystem model of diverse recycling and cascading material and energy flow systems has been used in industrial systems that are contrasting to this, operating with linear flows and unsustainable. Understanding the evolution of industrial systems over time toward sustainable or unsustainable ways of operating is important for learning about environmental performance analyses as well as for future planning of policy and management. The evolution over time of the Uimaharju forest industry park in Eastern Finland is studied. First, the system development is described by identifying the number of IE-type ‘roundput’ material and energy flows denoting waste utilisation and sustainable use of renewables. Second, development of the system over time is shown in terms of the number of the actors involved. This structural characteristic is termed system ‘diversity’. Third, the relation of the two is considered. Fourth, the drivers of the case system development are discussed. Fifth, an initial effort is made to calculate some of the environmental effects of the system during its development. An increase in roundput and diversity over time is observed. Diversity is affecting roundput. The park tends to enlarge its activities outside the industrial park boundary over time. While the system illustrates high roundput and high diversity, we can only speculate if these characteristics contribute to sustainability, because of difficulties in system boundary definition.},

	abstract = {Using nonhazardous wastes as inputs to production creates environmental benefits by avoiding disposal impacts, mitigating manufacturing impacts, and conserving virgin resources. China has incentivized reuse since the 1980s through the “Comprehensive Utilization of Resources (CUR)” policy. To test whether and to what extent environmental benefits are generated, 862 instances in Jiangsu, China are analyzed, representing eight industrial sectors and 25 products that qualified for tax relief through CUR. Benefits are determined by comparing life cycle inventories for the same product from baseline and CUR-certified production, adjusted for any difference in the use phase. More than 50 million tonnes of solid wastes were reused, equivalent to 51\% of the provincial industrial total. Benefits included reduction of 161 petajoules of energy, 23 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, 75 000 tonnes of SO2 equivalent, 33 000 tonnes of NOX, and 28 000 tonnes of PM10 equivalent, which were 2.5\%–7.3\% of the provincial industrial consumption and emissions. The benefits vary substantially across industries, among products within the same industry, and when comparing alternative reuse processes for the same waste. This first assessment of CUR results shows that CUR has established a firm foundation for a circular economy, but also suggest additional opportunities to refine incentives under CUR to increase environmental gain.},

Following a generic review of technical, political, economic, informational, and organisational factors that can have major influences on the development and functioning of IS networks and the role of coordination bodies aiming to catalyse the system developments, major political and institutional elements relevant to IS developments and applicable to all three regions are outlined. Experiences from individual IS programmes are then shared and analysed in light of technical, informational and organisational factors and the attributes of coordination bodies. Such analyses indicate the dominating importance of the organizational factors such as the history of industrial development, intensity of social interactions among relevant parties, and their mental proximity. Experiences also reveal that the perception of regional parties about the coordinating bodies is influential on the effectiveness of development efforts. A set of recommendations drawn from the analysis is intended to inform further similar efforts under National Industrial Symbiosis Programme (NISP). The paper concludes by highlighting the need of aligning the functioning of emerging networks with the requirements of longer term sustainability, which imposes higher challenges on coordination bodies.},

	abstract = {Industrial symbiosis is a process in which firms in regional industrial systems engage in the exchange of by-products and sharing of utilities and services in order to improve their environmental and economic performance. Industrial symbiosis has a prominent social dimension. To capture the social dimension concepts from the social sciences have been introduced to the field. This thesis makes one of the first attempts to bring these together in an integrated conceptual framework. The social dimension of industrial symbiosis refers specifically to the institutional capacity of actors to coordinate their actions and interactions towards industrial symbiosis. In the thesis, the implications of the conceptual framework are tested through empirical studies, the results of which are used to present an improved framework in the conclusions. At the core of the improved framework is a two-phases model of the process through which actors build institutional capacity for industrial symbiosis. In the first phase, a common ground emerges between independent projects, that are started for disparate purposes, but are also potential building blocks for industrial symbiosis. The presence of bridging actors ensures that the emergent common ground is recognized and translated to a shared vision. With the development of the vision, the building blocks are assembled into a larger collaborative process. This triggers the second phase, in which the collaborative process unfolds as an assemblage of interrelated projects, aimed at the implementation of industrial symbiosis. The thesis also makes methodological contributions. Throughout the thesis, different methods, techniques and tools for longitudinal research are introduced as part of an innovative methodology called Event Sequence Analysis.},

	abstract = {Urbanization and industrialization during the 20th century caused global climate change. South Korean industrial complexes were one of the key sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions as the most important cause of the climate change. South Korean government launched eco-industrial park projects for cleaner production and environmentally sustainable development in 2005. To assess the performance of the commercialized eco-industrial park projects in the mitigation of climate change, this study analyzed the direct CO2 emission reductions through the 41 eco-industrial park projects conducted from 2005 to 2012 in South Korea. The study classified the eco-industrial park projects according to their primary CO2 reduction function and analyzed the achievement of each type of project in terms of the direct CO2 emission reductions. These findings indicated that the eco-industrial park projects resulted in reduction of 0.48\% of CO2 emissions in 2004 from the South Korean industrial sector before the eco-industrial park projects began. Most of the projects were implemented effectively through networks for the sharing and exchanging of energies and resources. Therefore, spatial development planning for the effective relationship building among nodes in the network is required.

The study also identified that the performances and limitations of the eco-industrial park projects varied according to the reduced fuels and wastes, the recycled by-products and wastes, and locations of eco-industrial parks. Therefore, eco-industrial park projects should be associated with the other projects for the reduction of the CO2 emissions from other sources that cannot be reduced by eco-industrial park projects alone. Furthermore, to mitigate climate change at the administrative district level, local governments should cooperate with each other to perform the projects in urban and regional planning for environmentally and economically sustainable developments. This study will help develop suitable guidelines, standards, and policies for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to solve environmental and economical problems in the various regions and cities in the South Korea.},

One of the applications used is to transform the industrial system linear ‘throughput’ material and energy flow that relies on imported non-renewables, on virgin renewables and produces wastes and emissions dumped to nature toward a cyclical and cascading ‘roundput’ flow that relies on local/regional renewables and wastes. The paper constructs a key function or an anchor activity that integrates the throughput material and energy flows and changes them into the roundput model in a local/regional agricultural and food industry system in Finland. This key activity is able to simultaneously utilise and process waste flows from the main steps in the food products' life cycle (value chain) and produce energy and fertiliser to the different processes in the life cycle by using waste as a fuel and as a resource with value. Difficulties in achieving this vision in practice are discussed. The paper uses national data from Finland, regional data from the Satakunta region in southwest Finland and local data from the municipality of Huittinen in Satakunta. A methodology in which environmental, economic and social variables are studied with different ‘what if?’ scenarios for the roundput model and for the throughput model is presented.},

	abstract = {In the last decade, international organizations have expressed their concern about the capacity of classical economical indicators to encompass the whole story of the developing processes, especially in their relationship with the environment. A comprehensive environmental metrics has been adopted (states and organizations reports indicators like greenhouse gas emissions, ozone concentrations, surface of contaminated land, number of threatened species, etc.) and operates in parallel with the traditional industrial indicators. But it seems not enough since this complementary metrics does not illustrate the entire complexity of development processes, in the 21st Century. Recent EU documents stress the importance of sustainable development, of the importance of industrial symbiosis as a tool to better manage material, energy and human resources and evaluate the possibility of generating and reporting new, synthetic, composite indicators that could include both the information in the classical economical indicators but also the environmental impact and the quality of life.

The paper is a contribution in this respect and, starting from the results of the implementation of the Industrial Symbiosis paradigm in the case of a power plant, it presents how the EU recommendations about a more sophisticated metrics of ecoefficiency works, for the first time at the level of a Romanian enterprise. An original, new metrics is generated, that takes into account whether and how the technological and economical processes are accompanied by a favourable trend for the environment, A new, composite index for ecoefficiency and sustainability is presented in its structure and dynamic evolution, enabling local managers not only to assess their sustainable development trend, but also to identify where should their action be directed in the short term to correct unfavourable trends.

We build upon basic sustainability principles known as The Natural Step (TNS) System Conditions by identifying and selecting quantifiable indicators for each of the conditions in the case of our target symbiosis. The study reveals that the environmental impacts of the case IS became more far-reaching during the 110-year period studied. Emissions, however, decreased substantially after the 1970s due to tightening environmental legislation and other policy measures and the progress in environmental technology, not due to symbiosis-type of arrangements.

	abstract = {Industrial ecology represents an emerging interdisciplinary field of studying industrial systems in combination with their fundamental linkage with nature. An eye-catching characteristic at the basis of industrial ecology's scientific profile is its refreshingly unorthodox perspective of understanding nature as model, compared with other disciplines of understanding nature, e.g. in terms of ‘sack of resources’ or ‘biophysical limit’ as opposed to industrial systems. The idea of industrial ecology's appealing perspective is to balance the development of industrial systems with the constraints of natural ecosystems, analogous to an ‘industrial symbiosis’. On the basis of initial efforts to conceptualize industrial ecology's underlying assumptions concerning nature, a philosophically focused approach of its characteristic perspective of understanding nature as model is presented. The contribution may provide industrial ecologists as well as other economists, engineers, scientists and policy-makers involved in the field of sustainability with an opportunity for accessible philosophical reflection, perhaps bringing to the surface their tacit frames regarding nature. Consequently, the goal is to gain greater conceptual clarity and to contribute to laying a solid foundation for industrial ecology's stimulating role when initiating change towards sustainability at large.

The most often referenced eco-industrial park found in Kalundborg, Denmark, serves as an ideal, and is typified by tight interdependency between industrial partners, green logistics, and closed-loop supply chains. But the planet is in crisis [Atiyah and Press, joint statement from The Royal Society and the Hational Academy of Sciences on Population Growth and Sustainability, February 1992 ] and cannot afford to wait 30 years for more of these parks to emerge. Systems engineering has been found to be effective when bringing together stakeholders from diverse backgrounds and experts from multidisciplinary engineering and technical backgrounds to coordinate the creation of complex systems. This paper uses literature drawn from multidisciplinary sources to investigate the attributes of eco-industrial parks, and then proposes a systems engineering framework, iFACE, for the formation of eco-industrial parks. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {The Humber region, in North East England, is a major hub of industrial activity and trade. It has seen applications of industrial symbiosis for many years, initially centred on ‘top-down’ infrastructure projects with large capital investment but subsequently following a ‘bottom-up’ approach engaging industries in the area. Reductions in GHG emissions and waste generation have already been impressive. The possibilities for further savings, recognising the European Union’s aspirations for deep GHG cuts and the objectives of the A.SPIRE partnership involving 114 stakeholders from the process industries in Europe, have been explored in the LOCIMAP (low-carbon industrial manufacturing parks) project, which involved partners from across Europe. Industrial symbiosis has been central in the plans for LOCIMAP from the outset. Studies conducted for LOCIMAP have revealed that more substantial savings require industrial symbiosis to be designed in, rather than developed once facilities exist. Major further savings depend on co-location of activities in eco-industrial parks to enable systematic process integration, but following this approach raises further questions, including:

    How can such systems be engineered without compromising safety?

    What are the implications for system resilience?

    How does close integration affect operations such as maintenance?

The project has shown that we have the engineering ability to achieve deep reductions in energy use and GHG emissions provided industries can be located in eco-industrial parks with interactions designed according to thermodynamic principles. Barriers to realising this concept, to achieve a new industrial revolution, include an economic and fiscal system which means that design for optimal economic performance leads to different outcomes from designing for optimal environmental performance.},

	abstract = {The development of regional resource synergies in heavy industrial areas provides a significant avenue towards sustainable resource processing. Despite the fact that the number of examples of regional resource synergies around the world is growing, the reuse of inorganic by-products (e.g. bauxite residue, fly ash, kiln dusts, gypsum, slag) in Australia have not yet materialised on a significant scale. This is due to the fragmented approach adopted in the past and a range of barriers associated with their reuse. The drivers and barriers for inorganic by-product reuses appear to fall in nine broad categories: regulation, economics, community, technology, transportation, confidential and commercial issues, risk and liabilities, industry focus and priorities, and region specific issues. This paper shows that significant potential exist for the establishment of large volume reuse of these inorganic by-products in Australia, using the Kwinana Industrial Area as a case study. The inorganic by-products available in Kwinana could be used to supply the growing demand for already scarce building and construction materials in Western Australia. Although regulatory reuse standards exist elsewhere (e.g. European Union, USA), one of the main obstacles for the Kwinana industries is the absence of standard application protocols to allow for the routine use of their inorganic by-products. A coordinated stakeholder approach is being facilitated and applied in Kwinana that targets the realisation of large volume reuse opportunities that have both a good business and sustainability case and also government and community support. Based on the Kwinana experiences, this paper provides perspectives and learnings for elsewhere in Australia and in countries where current regulatory frameworks do not encourage or restrict the uptake of inorganic by-product reuses on a large scale.},

Past research illustrated that economic and environmental benefits appear self-evident, although detailed quantification has only been attempted of symbioses for energy and water utilities. This article provides a complimentary case study for Kawasaki, Japan. The 14 documented symbioses connect steel, cement, chemical, and paper firms and their spin-off recycling businesses. Seven key material exchanges divert annually at least 565 000 tons of waste from incineration or landfill. Four of these collectively present an estimated economic opportunity of 13.3 billion JPY (∼130 million USD) annually. Five symbioses involve utilization of byproduct and two sharing of utilities. The others are traditional or new recycling industries that do not specifically benefit from geographic proximity. The synergistic effect of urban and industrial symbiosis is unique. The legislative framework for a recycling-oriented society has contributed to realization of the symbioses, as has the availability of government subsidies through the Eco-Town program.},

	abstract = {Alcohol fuel is generally presented as a sustainable fuel in comparison with other fossil fuel due to lower emissions during production and combustion steps as well as due to its (assumed) closed carbon cycle. However, assessing the Brazilian traditional alcohol production cycle, many social and environmental impacts may still be indicated: burning, pesticides, biodiversity, labor exploration, high water consumption, erosion and others. Based on the strategy of an agro-industrial networking and symbiosis, a project was designed to optimize the system by means of polygeneration and total integration of production steps. The case presented in this paper is the project for a social and ecological agro-industry model, named GERIPA (Geração de Energia Renovável Integrada à Produção de Alimentos), which produces renewable fuel, electricity and organic food. Besides the technical project, an economic evaluation is also presented, resulting into a five year pay back time. In addition, environmental and social aspects were evaluated by means the Emergy Synthesis methodology (Odum, 1996), which assesses the value of all inputs through an estimate of the environmental work directly and indirectly required for their production and sustainable supply. The emergy-based comparison of GERIPA system and a traditional system in Brazil indicates better performance of GERIPA, with an eMergy Sustainability Index of 1.26, much higher than for a traditional system, 0.22. The project is presently under discussion with investors and Government and, if approved, will be carried out in marginal and presently unused land. In addition to providing an environmentally friendly process for food and energy production, the project would generate new jobs opportunities for Brazilian rural workers presently unemployed.},

	abstract = {Abstract There is a dilemma for rapid industrializing China to balance economic growth and low carbonization. Industrial symbiosis (IS) provides a system innovation to utilize the industry to fight climate change and pursue sustainable urban development, while few attentions are paid in literatures. Under this circumstance, this study reviews the low-carbon city practice in China and conducts a case study to calculate the CO2 emissions reduction potential under promoting IS projects in two cities of China, named Jinan and Liuzhou. With the real national project in Jinan as advanced example, new scenarios related to IS are designed for Liuzhou, including comprehensive energy network, waste plastics recycling, scrap tires recycling and flying ash recycling. The material/waste and energy exchange is quantified in the IS network, as well as the related environmental benefit. The material/energy exchange is over 10 million ton and 20 thousands tce in Jinan's case, and 2.5 million ton and 45 thousand tce in Liuzhou's case. Results highlight that IS could effectively reduce CO2 emissions. The total reduction potential amounts to 3944.05 thousands tCO2/year and 2347.88 thousands tCO2/year in Jinan and Liuzhou. Finally, policy implications on the ever-improvement of industrial symbiosis and China's sustainable urban development are proposed and discussed.},

	abstract = {In the production of biofuels for transport many critics have argued about the poor energy efficiency and environmental performance of the production industries. Optimism is thus set on the production of second generation biofuels, while first generation biofuels continue to dominate worldwide. Therefore it is interesting to consider how the environmental performance of first generation biofuel industries can be improved. The field of industrial symbiosis offers many possibilities for potential improvements in the biofuel industry and theories from this research field are used in this paper to highlight how environmental performance improvements can be accomplished. This comes in the form of by-product synergies and utility synergies which can improve material and energy handling. Furthermore, the processes and products can gain increased environmental performance improvements by the adaption of a renewable energy system which will act as a utility provider for many industries in a symbiotic network. By-products may thereafter be upcycled through biogas production processes to generate both energy and a bio-fertilizer. A case study of an actual biofuel industrial symbiosis is also reviewed to provide support for these theories.},

Studies have explored supply chain environmental sustainability development and provided different approaches for developing environmentally sustainable supply chains. These include environmental management, design for environment, product stewardship, green purchasing, reverse logistics, recycling, reuse, and remanufacturing. These approaches have often been considered independently. Industrial Ecology and Industrial Symbiosis offer systematic thinking for companies to integrate key elements of these approaches into their supply chain environmental sustainability development. This study aims to develop a conceptual framework to embrace the integration and identify opportunities for companies to work collaboratively. The initial framework was proposed based on the review of the literature associated with environmentally sustainability supply chain management, Industrial Ecology, and Industrial Symbiosis. The initial framework is improved by corroborating the case study company's experience, a large UK distributor. Different hierarchies in waste management have also been considered when developing the framework. The paper emphasises the importance of prevention and reduction methods. The developed framework illustrates the areas and opportunities for supply chain parties to work collaboratively towards environmentally friendly activities. The developed framework contributes to the environmentally sustainable supply chain management literature and encourages companies to apply Industrial Ecology and Industrial Symbiosis to develop their environmentally sustainable supply chains.},

As a test case, we evaluated South Korean EIP pilot projects that primarily focus on the development of industrial symbiosis networks in existing industrial complexes. The results demonstrated that networks with high initial investment or higher value-added products tend to have high economic performance. Additionally, several projects involving energy networks have resulted in high positive environmental performance through greenhouse gas emissions mitigation. Waste acid/alkali solution recycling projects also showed remarkable social outcomes on account of the variety of networks formed and active participation from enterprises. The present approach incorporating the DCF and MAGIQ methods provides a simple and promising decision-making tool for quantitative performance evaluation of EIP pilot projects. Furthermore, valuable lessons from the evaluation considering economic, environmental, and social performances will provide the basis for future EIP establishment.},

Given that emissions trading schemes for greenhouse gases are becoming more widely implemented, the definition of the carbon property right can affect barriers and opportunities for industrial ecology, alongside other factors. The paper uses legislation for emissions trading in Australia and two possible scenarios for the future of energy generation in the Latrobe Valley, Australia in 2050 as an illustrative case study to identify issues for industrial ecology arising from ill-defined carbon property rights. Currently, electricity generation in the region is reliant on coal-based generators. Scenario one focuses on bio-industries and renewables with no coal usage; and scenario two focuses on electricity from coal with carbon capture and storage resulting in moderate to high coal use. If a carbon property right for soil carbon emerges before a property right for subterranean carbon, then bio-based industrial ecology opportunities could be enabled ahead of a regional symbiosis involving carbon capture and storage. A generalised framework for considering the intersection of industrial ecology and carbon property rights is presented with a focus on tensions in: contributing to sustainable development, system boundaries and finally exchange mechanisms.},

This new certification method is analysed by focusing on the prevention of pollution. The criteria required to obtain the qualification, and the roles and responsibilities of all the actors involved are outlined. Finally, the strengths and weaknesses of the certification scheme are highlighted and the Italian standard compared with the national standard issued in China by the State Environmental Protection Administration.

	abstract = {Abstract Industrial symbiosis (IS) improves regional sustainability through inter-firm collaboration for more efficient use of materials and energy. Drawing on the literature of IS and complex networks, this paper proposes three forming processes of IS networks corresponding to different institutional settings – preferential growth under self-organization, homogeneous growth under coordination and facilitation, and random pairing under planning and policy promotion. We examine the growth of IS networks and the impact of promotional institutions by analyzing a diverse sample of 15 IS networks including 204 firms. Additional illustrations of by-product and utility networks are provided for the cases of Kalundborg (Denmark) and Kwinana (Australia). The results suggest that preferential growth is a dominant process widely held in self-organized IS networks, indicating an enduring disparity of firms' capabilities in building IS. Firm-organized coordination as well as government facilitation and promotion tend to change the preferential growth to a more homogeneous one, by improving the capabilities of previously disadvantaged firms. The improvement of disadvantaged firms and non-preferential growth under facilitation and promotion call for the overall symbiotic opportunities to be explored more thoroughly, and render the IS system more resilient in a region. This effect of policy promotion, however, may take time to change the IS system, and may be diminished in utility exchanges and in areas with fewer, undiversified firms, due to technical difficulties and lack of opportunities to expand an existing IS network. Policy-making and planning should take into consideration the local industry composition and context, as well as other cost associated with the policies to determine the appropriate extent of promotion and incentives.},

	abstract = {Abstract As an important means of achieving sustainable development, eco-industrial parks have been given great significance at every level of Chinese governments, and as a result, they have made great strides in China. The increasing pressures of resource constraints and the need for environmental protection have made the achievement of optimal sustainable development performance crucial. Managers of eco-industrial park administrative committees, as decision makers and executors, have a pivotal role in the design, plan, and organization for the sustainable development of eco-industrial parks. Furthermore managers' environmental awareness is important when organizing environmental practices in their eco-industrial parks. This paper seeks to establish the value of the effects of managers' environmental awareness on the relationships between environmental practices and sustainable development performance by presenting an analysis of Chinese eco-industrial park projects. Using an empirical study, this paper first identifies the key environmental practices, directed by managers, which impact the sustainable development performance of Chinese eco-industrial parks. The moderating effect of managers' environmental awareness on the relationships between environmental practices and sustainable development performance is then developed. Our results show that instituting environmental norms for eco-industrial park enterprises, building industrial symbiosis, and providing guidance to key enterprises play significant roles in producing sustainable development performance for eco-industrial parks. Managers' environmental awareness is helpful in driving and transforming environmental practices into sustainable development performance. Our results also provide assistance for designing and implementing environmental practices for sustainable development, recruiting managers with higher environmental awareness, and training managers to improve their environmental awareness so that eco-industrial parks can achieve sustainable development performance.},

In this case, the traditional planned economic system of China was the main reason for the existence of the sectoral boundary in HHIE. The sectoral boundary restricted the establishment of potential symbiotic linkages between companies. Going beyond the sectoral boundary was necessary in order to promote industrial ecosystem development. The government played a crucial role in breaking the sectoral boundary. It was “a key stage” in the development of HHIE. Breaking the sectoral boundary was achieved through the approach of establishing a salt-soda combination, i.e., establishing the Hai Hua Group (HHG).

	abstract = {Abstract This paper explores various forms of eco-industrial networks in advancing environmental sustainability. Prior research on environmental sustainability primarily identifies industrial actors as autonomous entities or considers the role of networks in advancing environmental sustainability from a rather narrow perspective. However, the networks of ties in which industrial firms are embedded profoundly impacts not only their own performance, but also the natural environment in which they operate. Based on a systematic literature review, we identify four forms of eco-industrial networks that have the potential to advance environmental sustainability: 1) symbiosis networks, 2) sustainable supply networks, 3) environmental issue networks and 4) environmental solution networks. The paper presents important insights on the operational logic for each of these network forms and the dimensions of their network architecture. The main implications of this comparison are that policy-makers and practitioners need to become aware of the various mechanisms through which inter-organisational networks can reduce environmental load. Furthermore, there is a need to build broad coalitions of organisations that are mobilised to address environmental issues. We suggest that network architecture which maximises its members' capability to self-organise while also including a coordinating organisation can be highly suitable for eco-industrial networks. We also suggest some fruitful avenues for future research on eco-industrial networks. In integrating research on eco-industrial networks with existing research on inter-organisational alliances and networks, the paper provides more understanding on the multifaceted role played by various forms of eco-industrial networks in advancing sustainability.},

	abstract = {Abstract By strengthening material metabolism among collocated enterprises in leading industrial production chains in eco-industrial parks (EIPs), an industrial symbiosis (IS) system can be constructed, which is effective in strengthening the circular economy (CE). It has become important for EIPs to quantitatively evaluate the CE performance of the production chain while also seeking specific measures that could promote resources utilization efficiency. In this paper, we combine the substance flow analysis (SFA) approach with the resource productivity (RP) indicator to evaluate the contribution of IS to the development of circular economy. Through questionnaires and field surveys of key enterprises in Suzhou New District (SND), a substance flow analysis and resource productivity indicator were developed for core materials (copper, water and energy) in printed circuit boards (PCB) production under the excluding waste utilization scenario and including waste utilization scenario. The results show that the RPCu of chain from electrolytic copper production enterprises (ECPE) to electrolytic copper foil production enterprises is respectively 21.38 and 23.15 thousand yuan per ton, from ECPE to copper clad laminate (CCL) production enterprises is respectively 64.15 and 71.32 thousand yuan per ton, and from ECPE to PCB production enterprises is respectively 176.47and 211.21 thousand yuan per ton under the two scenarios. RP is enhanced by prolonging the industrial production chain and the RP under the excluding waste utilization scenario is higher than the including waste utilization scenario for the same chain, which can be achieved through greater IS. Finally we propose further implications on developing CE in EIPs.},

Besides methodologies developed for thermal systems analysis, diagnosis and optimization, application of thermoeconomics to industrial symbiosis requires the development of new methods such as those presented here. First, two decomposition strategies for exergy costs are proposed (according to: (i) irreversibility and (ii) origin of resources). Then, a fuel impact approach for locating and quantifying the origin of resources savings due to integration is presented. A simplified version of the Kalundborg eco-industrial park is used as a test-bench for the presented methodologies.},

	abstract = {Recovery, reuse and recycling of industrial residuals, often dismissed as wastes, are common in India and other industrializing countries largely due to lower associated costs. Some wastes are reused within the facility where they are generated, others are reused directly by nearby industrial facilities, and some are recycled via the formal and informal recycling markets. Direct inter-firm reuse is the cornerstone of the phenomenon termed industrial symbiosis, where firms cooperate in the exchange of material and energy resources. This study applies material flow analysis to an economically diverse industrial area in South India to characterize the recovery, reuse and recycling of industrial residuals. It quantifies the generation of waste materials from 42 companies as well as the materials that are directly traded across facilities and those that are recycled or disposed. This study encompasses a business cluster in Mysore in the State of Karnataka, and is the first in India to thoroughly quantify material flows to identify existing symbiotic connections in an industrial area. Examined industries in this industrial area generate 897,210 metric tons of waste residuals annually, and recovered 99.5\% of these, 81\% with reused by the companies that generated them, with one company, a sugar refinery, processing most of this amount. Geographic data show that operations within 20 km of the industrial area receive over 90\% of residuals exiting facility gates. Two-thirds of this amount goes directly to other economic actors for reuse. This study makes key contributions to the literature in distinguishing how particular types of materials are reused in different ways, the geographic extent of symbiotic activities and the important role of the informal sector in industrial waste management in industrializing regions.},

	abstract = {Industrial ecology (IE) is a biological concept applied to industrial structures. The basic concepts of IE include regional, intra-firm and product-based waste recycling systems as well as the principle of upward and downward cascading. In best current examples of regional systems, several parties are in an industrial waste re-use symbiosis. Paper industry has learned to arrange the recovery and re-use of its products on distant markets, even up to a level where indications of exceeding optimal recovery and re-use rates already exist through deteriorated fibre and product quality. Such occurrences will take place in certain legislative- economic situations. Paper industry has many cascade levels, each with their internal recovery and recycling, as well as many intra-firm. regional, and life cycle ecology structures. As an example of prospects for individual cascading routes, sludges may continue to be incinerated, but the route to landfills will be closed. The main obstacles of legislative drive toward better IE systems are in many cases existing laws and political considerations rather than economic or technical aspects. The study and practice of engineering human technology systems and related elements of natural systems should develop in such a way that they provide quality of life by aclively managing the dynamics of relevant systems to reduce the risk and scale of undesirable behavior and outcomes. For the paper industry, earth systems engineering offers several development routes. One of them is the further recognition of and research on the fact that the products of the industry are returned back to the carbon cycle of the natural environment. Opportunities for modifying current earth systems may also be available for the industry, e.g. genetically modified plants for raw materials or organisms for making good quality pulp Out of current raw materials. It is to be recognized that earth systems engineering may become a very controversial area, and that very diverse political pressures may determine its future usefulness to the paper industry.},

This study aims to quantitatively examine the effects of IS performance on carbon emission reduction through a case study on Xinfa Group, a comprehensive large enterprise group in China.

The largest carbon emission sector is the electrolytic aluminum industry, which accounts for 70.2\% of the total. The carbon emissions under the IS condition at Xinfa Group decrease by 10.84\% compared with that under the no IS condition. The carbon emission reduction primarily results from byproduct exchange and energy symbiosis, with rates of 72\% and 28\%, respectively. Carbon emission reduction as a result of energy-graded utilization is 11.4\%. Carbon emission reduction from calcined lime, alumina, calcium carbide, and other industries accounts for 60.7\%, 18.7\%, 0.9\%, and 27.1\% of the total emission reduction, respectively.

	abstract = {Publisher Summary Nonhazardous industrial waste (NHIW) is distinct from both municipal solid waste (MSW), the more familiar mix from homes and businesses, and hazardous waste, materials that are more highly regulated owing to their toxicity and related public health concerns. The sheer quantities of NHIW raise the question of how best to manage it. The first defense is cleaner production—generating less waste by increasing industrial efficiency and effectiveness. A broad range of companies now produce annual sustainability reports detailing the amount of waste reduced in particular categories, year to year. For wastes that continue to be generated, many large volume industrial streams are amenable to separate handling such as foundry sand, coal ash, and paper mill sludge, some of these streams have an excellent track record for reuse. Specifically, industrial symbiosis is part of a new field called industrial ecology. Industrial ecology is principally concerned with the flow of materials and energy through systems at different scales, from products to factories and up to national and global levels. Industrial symbiosis focuses on these flows through networks of businesses and other organizations in local and regional economies as a means of approaching ecologically sustainable industrial development. It engages traditionally separate industries in a collective approach to competitive advantage involving physical exchange of materials, energy, water, and/or by-products. The keys to industrial symbiosis are collaboration and the synergistic possibilities offered by geographic proximity.},

	abstract = {Abstract Nowadays, industrial symbiosis is a key concept of industrial ecology, which studies material and energy exchange flows in the local industrial systems to reduce the costs, e.g., the wastes treatment cost, and to reduce the pollution, e.g., greenhouse gas emissions. An industrial park is a set of manufacturing businesses producing different products and by-products located at the same place (city, region, etc.). As the concept of this model encourages the development of synergy and leverage of resource networks, to the advantage of all of the enterprises present in an industrial park, a general mathematical model has been proposed. The aims of this general model are: to maximize total quantity of exchanges flows, to maximize total economic benefice of an industrial park, and to reduce relative environmental pollution, industrial waste treatment cost and delivery cost. This model can assure a win-win situation for industries and environment. There are rigorous mathematical models for specific ecological industrial parks [1]. To the best of our knowledge, there is no currently other general mathematical model for designing and optimizing an ecological industrial park. In addition, there is no currently complete ecological industrial park in France.},

	abstract = {Backcasting has been widely used for developing energy futures. This paper explores the potential for using industrial ecology to guide the development of energy futures within a backcasting framework. Building on the backcasting work of Robinson [1], a seven step method is presented to embed industrial ecology principles within the development and assessment of future scenarios and transition paths toward them. The approach is applied to the case of backcasting regional energy futures in the Latrobe Valley, near Melbourne, Australia. This region has substantial brown coal deposits which are currently mined and used in coal-fired power stations to generate electricity. Bounded by a sustainability vision for the region in a carbon-constrained world, regional industrial ecologies in 2050 were backcast around three themes: bio-industries and renewables (no coal usage); electricity from coal with carbon capture and storage (low to high coal usage); and coal to products such as hydrogen, ammonia, diesel, methanol, plastics and char (demonstrating medium to high overall coal use relative to current levels). Potential environmental, technological, socio-political and economic impacts of each scenario across various life cycle stages were characterised. Results offer a platform for regional policy development to underpin deliberation on a preferred future by the community, industry and other stakeholders. Industrial ecology principles were found to be useful in backcasting for creatively articulating alternative futures featuring industrial symbiosis. However, enabling the approach to guide implementation of sustainable transition pathways requires further development and would benefit from integration within the Strategic Sustainable Development framework of Robèrt et al. [2].},

Results show the environmental benefits of industrial symbiosis performances in 2011, and argue that economic benefits, mainly resulted from stricter environmental standards, tax preference, benefits from material substitution, and financial subsidies, is the critical driver for the stakeholders to participate in industrial symbiosis. The action of governments in industrial symbiosis development is to constituting strict environmental standards, resource comprehensive utilization schemes, financial support and circular economy and eco-industrial park planning guidance.

	abstract = {In several industrialised countries, there have occurred initiatives to establish eco-industrial parks. Originally, these were mainly based upon the exchange of resources between heavy industries in industrial complexes. These initiatives are generally referred to with the concepts of industrial symbiosis and eco-industrial parks. Since then, the concept of eco-industrial parks has been extended to another relevant type of industrial park, the so-called mixed industrial park, which consists of various small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), sometimes complemented by a small number of larger industries. Because of the resulting growing ambiguity in the significance of eco-industrial park initiatives, a typology is desirable for entangling the confusion that is introduced. It is argued that mixed industrial parks are poorly investigated although they have a major environmental and spatial impact, Starting from a general consideration of eco-industrial park initiatives, this paper describes the societal and environmental problems that are related to the mixed industrial parks, proposes solutions and discusses the counteracting factors. While our argument relates strongly to the traditionally industrialised countries, it is also relevant to newly industrialised countries, as they are faced with similar problems, or will encounter them in the near future.

Most studies focus on energy consumption emission reduction and energy efficiency improvement. Material saving is also important for carbon emission reduction from a lifecycle perspective. IS (Industrial symbiosis) and UrS (urban symbiosis) have been effective since both of them encourage byproduct exchange. However, quantitative carbon emission reduction evaluation on applying them is still lacking. Consequently, the purpose of this paper is to fill such a gap through a case study in Kawasaki Eco-town, Japan. A hybrid LCA model was employed to evaluate to the lifecycle carbon footprint. The results show that lifecycle carbon footprints with and without IS and UrS were 26.66 Mt CO2e and 30.92 Mt CO2e, respectively. The carbon emission efficiency was improved by 13.77\% with the implementation of IS and UrS. The carbon emission reduction was mainly from “iron \& steel” industry, cement industry and “paper making” industry, with figures of 2.76 Mt CO2e, 1.16 Mt CO2e and 0.34 Mt CO2e, respectively. Reuse of scrape steel, blast furnace slag and waste paper are all effective measures for promoting carbon emission reductions. Finally, policy implications on how to further promote IS and UrS are presented.},

	abstract = {Abstract With the growing environmental concern, there is evidence that increasing symbiotic relationship between plants in the same industrial area, highly contributes to a more sustainable development of industrial activities. The concept of industrial ecology extended to the terms of eco-industrial park (or ecopark) or industrial symbioses is the topic of extensive research since the five last years. More particularly, even if a lot of ecopark examples and realizations already exist throughout the world, a lot of ecopark proposals are in progress but not achieved. Recently, this vision leads the research community to focus on works proposing methods to optimize the exchanges of an ecopark prior to its design and construction. We find it especially interesting for the scientific community to propose a detailed paper review focused on optimization works devoted to the design of eco industrial parks. This paper is based on a comprehensive literature search in Web of Science database for publications that listed ‘industrial symbiosis' (or ‘eco industrial park', or ‘inter plant integration') and ‘optimization'. This study is segmented into different sections with first, a description of the different concepts evoked in the literature. Then, the several types of networking in an eco-industrial park are detailed in association with the optimization methods employed to solve each problem. The following sections reviews the different objective functions that are formulated to optimally design an eco-industrial park. The last part of the paper is devoted to a critical analysis of the state of the art by proposing several routes to improve the methodologies found in the literature. Another aim of this paper review consists in finding the gaps existing in previous studies. These major gaps are found to be: the lack of multiobjective optimization studies, the absence of social/societal objectives formulation also needs to be addressed and the lack of works taking into account flexibility of ecoparks in an operational point of view.},

Integrating industrial symbiosis into the corporate development plans to optimize materials and energy flows is a feasible strategy for many corporations in their transition between nonsustainable and sustainable development. By constructing industrial ecosystems, Nanning Sugar Co., Ltd. in China, has achieved the successful transition from a traditional corporation to a sustainable corporation, or rather, a circular corporation. This study expounds on its whole transition course to a circular complex in the past decade, in which four factors are essential to making this symbiosis achievable: rational production structures; raw materials advantages; technical supports and correct diversification. The corporation is in charge of almost all the aspects of its affiliated companies and the management mode, in particular, differing from that of industrial symbiosis systems in Kalundborg, is considered another potential factor contributing to the corporate success. The transition mode in question is hoped to point to a feasible development path for similar corporations.},

Treatment of the waste is expensive, and cities face challenges on waste disposal sites. A sustainable solution would be to realize industrial symbioses. The typical approach is to design and develop industrial parks each of which is aimed to be an industrial symbiosis. This approach is proven by successful cases, but is constrained by land scarce cities as well as the limited types and scales of the companies that can be included in an industrial park. The paper proposes a big data analytics approach to realize industrial symbioses among the industries in a city's close proximity. The waste streams and resource requirements of existing companies are identified and matched with resources needs directly or indirectly through conversion processes.

	abstract = {Industrial symbiosis (IS) emerged as a collective, multi-industrial approach to improve economic and environmental performance through the use of wastes/by-products as substitutes for raw materials. The development of IS initiatives depends on the context in which they occur, characterised in terms of social, economic, political, spatial and temporal embeddedness. As a consequence, the context can be influenced to become more supportive of IS through a continuous, interactive process, combining top-down governmental directives and bottom-up spontaneous business initiatives. A strategy to develop and enhance this process is explored in this paper and described by the authors as a middle-out approach.

Policies and policy instruments introduced by governmental agencies provide objectives and incentives to businesses. The middle-out approach induces the development of a strategy to create positive feedback loops among agents (e.g. government, industries) that may guide their actions into setting the conditions to support IS emergence.

This paper provides a case study that discusses a regional development of IS in Portugal that highlights critical factors for success in implementing IS, and shows that the middle-out approach can also be understood as an extension and combination of previous research on context factors and planned/spontaneous approaches to IS development.},

These are analysed within the context of experiences gained in the early stages of three regional IS programmes under development in the UK, and of the recently launched national IS programme (NISP) that they are part of. It is stated that the policy framework in the UK has elements supportive of such networks to evolve, and the regional public bodies are favouring their development. Based on differences among studied cases, it is argued that the nature of companies' operations and industrial history in the regions, the extent of peer pressure, the positioning of the coordinating body in the region, and its approach to awareness raising and recruitment have major influence on the progress of the programmes. Finally, the paper emphasises the importance of aligning the characteristics of emerging operations with the longer-term sustainability requirements. If accepted, this challenge assigns additional responsibilities to the coordinating parties. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Abstract With material and energy flow features, iron/steel industry has unique advantage in the industrial symbiosis (IS) formation to realize environmental and economic benefit simultaneously. The quantification of the scale and significance of IS benefits is valuable for IS promotion, while there is much few attention to it, especially in China. Under this circumstance, this paper evaluates and compares the number, scale and the related environmental/economic gains of IS activities in iron/steel-centered industrial areas in Liuzhou and Jinan in China, and Kawasaki in Japan. Results show that: in Liuzhou, there are three symbiosis activities between industries. The annual by-product/waste exchange is more than 2 million ton/y, gaining economic revenue more than 36.55 million USD for the iron/steel company. In Jinan, seven symbiotic links are between industries, and two are between urban community and iron/steel plant. The total by-product/waste exchange is over 8 million ton/y and the economic gains account to 158 million USD. In Kawasaki, iron/steel industry relates to four symbiotic links, the total by-product/waste exchange amount is about 500 kton/y, with the economic gains over 54 million USD. The form and the complexity of the IS network are different in the three cases. IS in Liuzhou and Jinan are with the features of large number and scale, but single types. While in Kawasaki, IS includes not only traditional exchanges between iron/steel plant and the other industries, but also the innovative utilization of urban refuse by industrial area. Finally, from the perspective of technology, legislative framework and support policy, circular technology inventory, integrated waste management system, information platform and national subsidies are needed to support the ever-improvement of IS promotion in China's iron/steel industry.},

	abstract = {Abstract Industrial symbiosis (IS) involves two or more companies interlinked through the exchange of materials, heat, water and by-products. In fact, the evolution of industrial symbiosis could be part of a dynamic process leading to the development of a regional industrial ecosystem. Based on a regional context, this paper investigates a three-level approach, i.e., individual firm level, inter-firm level, and regional level, which incorporates cleaner production (CP) and IS to seek potential opportunities for improvement in an operating industrial zone. It was applied in the symbiosis in the Hai Hua Group (HHG) of China. The information was collected through survey questionnaires, open-ended interviews and cleaner production reports from companies. Implementing the three-level approach mainly shows that: (1) all the companies that implemented a cleaner production audit achieved economic and environmental benefits, (2) an existing symbiotic network was discovered, and (3) some potential symbiotic links were identified both at the inter-firm level and the regional level. Integrating cleaner production with industrial symbiosis, the relationship between the industrial symbiosis and its surrounding region, and the role of the government of implementing the three-level approach are discussed. In addition, some barriers were identified and possible resolutions are suggested. It can be concluded that the three-level approach is helpful to integrate CP and IS within a region and provides a useful guidance for discovering industrial symbiosis and promoting its development.},

	abstract = {Abstract In the post-crisis approach to welfare states, the role of authorities as providers of welfare becomes more pronounced. As local authorities across the European Union are confronted with new and often unfavourable financing mechanisms, the performance and management of mandatory and voluntary duties must be reconsidered. As sustainable development and a more frugal management of public funds becomes more important, local authorities need to find new and innovative ways to mitigate their expenditures. The authors anticipate that local authorities will be interested in a more active participation in industrial ecological systems with advantages for sustainability. The fundamental question is: how could the process of finding potential partners for industrial ecological partnerships between businesses, and between businesses and the authority be facilitated? The authors review the concept of industrial ecology and its potential benefits; and also highlight the possible connection points between local governments and a business cluster, through an overview of mandatory and voluntary duties and responsibilities local governments must perform. The main answer to the research question is the framework of a novel decision support system (DSS) to facilitate the establishment of new connections and rationalise existing ones in pursuit of greater efficiency at reduced costs, whilst also promoting the aims of sustainable development. Finally, the authors consider the wider regional economic consequences of the DSS in the attractiveness of the eco-industrial cluster to new entrants, through the exploration of a set of plausible scenarios will be explored.},

	abstract = {Abstract Industrial synergies – be they, the single by-product exchanges between two companies or the comprehensive industrial symbiosis networks involving numerous industrial synergies – have been recognized for their potential to improve industrial resource efficiency and provide simultaneous economic benefits. With increasing research on maximizing the implementation of industrial symbiosis initiatives per se, the notion of quality of these implemented exchanges has been disregarded. Nevertheless the quality and consideration of whole production life cycle impacts of industrial symbiosis initiatives are important to ensure harmonic and sustainable development. To develop and promote a strategy for advancement of new and qualitative industrial synergies the analysis and evaluation of existing examples of collaboration is necessary. To provide a means for evaluation and comparison of the quality of industrial synergies, a qualitative evaluation method is developed. An illustration of the evaluation method is presented through two case studies of industrial synergies identified in the brewery industry and the wood processing industry in Latvia. The results of these case studies provide valuable information for decision makers in Latvia and industrial symbiosis practitioners worldwide. Case study results show that only few of the considered self-organized industrial synergies are beneficial regarding all three – environmental quality, economic quality and geographic proximity – evaluation categories. This leads to the conclusion that these three aspects create a three-layer filter for development of qualitative industrial synergies and the quality of each category should be considered before the planning stage of such collaborations.},

With the introduction of asymmetric distribution coefficient as a quantitative index, the distribution of symbiosis cost and symbiosis profit can be analyzed. An illustrative example demonstrates that the approach can be used to assess the stability of a hypothetical coal-based symbiosis system under different states.

In Jinqiao EIP, Pudong New Area, Shanghai, an industrial symbiosis, based on the energy recovery from municipal sewage sludge and re-refined oil, was proposed in the central heat-supplying company of Jinqiao EIP. It is expected that hot off-gas or part of the steam from the central heat-supplying company could be used for sludge drying and used oil re-refining while the dried sludge and refined oil can be partial substitution for fossil fuel. For the purpose of assessing the environmental performance of this industrial symbiosis, life cycle assessment (LCA) was used and different scenarios were set up in this study to evaluate the Global warming Potential (GWP), Acidification Potential (AP), Eutrophication Potential (EP), Human toxicity air (HTA) and Total Environmental Impact Potential (TEIP) of the system. Results indicate that when the substitute ratio of coal by sludge is 14\%, the proposed industrial symbiosis has the least environmental impact. Compared with the current situation (sludge is landfilled), co-combustion of dried sludge and re-refined oil with coal at optimal scale will release less CO2, CH4, NOx, N2O and CO, but more SO2, H2S, NH3, HCl, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) and heavy metals.},

Biofuels are an example of an industry that needs to be based on a system of rather small-scale local production units due to the limited transportation radius of biomass. Moreover, the benefits of biofuels are greater if their production is based on the integration of local production activities and consumption among traditionally separate industries, as implied by the notion of industrial symbiosis. Such an arrangement, however, requires the establishment of industrial ecosystems that are customised to local conditions, which increases costs and uncertainty for the involved stakeholders and the integrating company. In this paper, we discuss replication strategy as a means of transferring not only technical knowledge, but also the business format to new locations, thereby achieving ‘economies of repetition'. The case of a biogas-for traffic solution serves as an illustrative example. We analyse the establishment of a ‘vanguard' ecosystem and assess the potential of replicating the solution in six other locations. Based on this, we propose a replication framework that builds on functional modularisation, collaboration mechanisms required for cooperating with the relevant stakeholders, and organisational learning. The replication approach is expected to be useful for the companies attempting to build sustainable distributed energy systems based on industrial symbiosis.},

	abstract = {Abstract Power plants are one of key energy sources for industrial symbiosis complexes. However, decarbonization of the power sector, including decommissioning of existing fossil-fuel power plants, aggregation of power plant sites, and capacity augmentation of carbon-free power plants, is necessary to achieve low-carbon societies in the long term. Decarbonization results in declining advantage for industrial symbiosis complexes that rely on fossil-fuel power plants. To establish sustainable industrial symbiosis complexes, we used a quantitative model to analyze optimal locations and scales for power plants in Japan considering CO2 emissions reduction targets and several demand scenarios. Our results showed that even with a target of 80\% CO2 emission reduction, almost half of Japan's electricity generation could come from fossil-fuel power plants in 2050 if CCS technology were deployed widely. Fossil-fuel power plants would be developed mainly in the regions of high electricity demand and little wind power potential, such as Tokyo, Chubu, and Kansai. From an intra-regional perspective, fossil-fuel power plants could be constructed in areas of high electricity demand. In addition, except for the above areas, generation from fossil-fuel power plants would vary in accordance with the availability of renewables and electricity demand. Our results indicate that future climate policy, regional electricity demand, and availability of regional renewables should be considered when planning the development of industrial symbiosis complexes.},

	abstract = {The trend of clustering industries into regional estates or cities was adopted in the mid 1900's. At present, the number of industrial estates in the world is estimated to be between 12,000 and 20,000 (UNEP, 1997) and this trend is continuing to rise in both developed and developing countries. The implementation of the EIP concept continues to evolve especially with the environmental threats and impact on climate change that industries pose. However, there is not yet a fully developed EIP that is operating; although some successful examples of regional by-product exchanges are functioning (Lowe, 2001; Peck, 2002; Lowe et al., 1995: Chertow, 2000). Actually, a significant number of projects have failed or have abandoned the goal of becoming an EIP. Furthermore the current body of knowledge on industrial ecology is not sufficient to provide practical solutions to the obstacles facing EIPs. This paper is based upon the Ph.D. Doctoral thesis research of D. Sakr. It was prepared to examine means to improve the uptake of cleaner production \& industrial symbiosis in industrial areas in Middle East \& North Africa Region focusing on Egypt as a case study. An extensive literature review was performed on eco-industrial development projects' experiences around the world, in order to identify the critical driving and limiting factors for EIPs. This paper summarizes the lessons learned from worldwide EIP experiences as a basis for the planning and implementation of future EIPs. The paper reflects as well upon the Egyptian context for the identified EIP success and limiting factors. The identified key success and limiting factors are: the creation of symbiotic relationship, information sharing and awareness, financial benefits, organizational structure, and legal and regulatory framework.

Additionally, an approach to distribute credits due to exchanges for firms in the industrial symbiosis network is outlined.

This article considers ports, understood as platforms of circulation and transformation of material and energy flows. It addresses the role and capacity of ports to foster the implementation of IE in port cities and to contribute to the optimization of resource management in coastal areas. This article presents the result of a research project (2011–2012) consisting of an international inventory of innovative resource management initiatives in port areas. 18 port-based industrial complexes were visited, enabling the analysis of 23 port IE initiatives. Cross-case analysis was carried out following a 3 step methodology: 1/ definition of the research boundaries; 2/ qualitative data collection by means of interviews and a literature review; 3/ data analysis in order to build a typology of port contribution to the implementation of IE in port-city areas. The case studies analyzed can be classified into 9 patterns based on temporal and spatial characteristics of P-IE initiatives. They provide insights on the ports' influence on local IE dynamics: as areas of testing and implementation of industrial symbiosis, ports can constitute exemplary self-sufficient areas, likely to boost the development of other local eco-parks; as drivers of local economic development, ports act as levers for the implementation of sustainable policies at a regional scale; as nodes in a global port network, ports can develop inter-port by-product exchanges and utility sharing. Ports question the relevance of geographical proximity in IE.},

	abstract = {Abstract Bioethanol has been considered as an important type of renewable energy that can help reduce energy crisis and environmental degradation. Under economic, technology, and sustainability consideration, food based 1st generation bioethanol and lignocellulosic-based 2nd generation bioethanol have to exist simultaneously. Therefore, it is necessary to design a hybrid generation bioethanol supply chain (HGBSC) to sustainably meet the ever-increasing energy demand and different government-mandated sustainability standards related to green sustainability such as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, irrigation land and water usage, and energy efficiency. This paper is the first to examine different type of bioethanol plant configurations including industrial symbiosis strategy in order to meet high sustainability standards and design robust and sustainable industrial symbiosis based hybrid generation bioethanol supply chains (ISHGBSC). A novel stochastic mixed integer linear programming (SMILP) model is proposed to design the optimal ISHGBSC under different sustainability standards. A case study of North Dakota (ND) in USA has been studied as an application of the proposed model. The results show that some sustainability standards are stronger than others in terms of the number of green sustainability requirements met. When stronger sustainability standards are applied, the economic performance of the ISHGBSC is sacrificed. The results provide a guideline for policymakers to determine the appropriate standard to use under different sustainable concerns, and for policymakers and investors the best ISHGSBC structure under each standard. In addition, the results provide investors a guideline to invest in different technologies under different sustainability standards. Sensitivity analyses is also conducted to provide deep understanding of the proposed ISHGBSC and to identify the factors that might impact the stability of the ISHGBSC under different standards.},

	abstract = {Abstract Establishment of an eco-industrial park is influenced by numerous internal and external factors. The evolution of an eco-industrial park is path-dependent acknowledging that both choices made in the past as well as the current context of the industrial sector are very important in determining its success. We study the industrial area of Venice, namely Porto Marghera, as a center of chemical industry activity in Italy, in order to understand two sets of factors that determine its destiny: the endogenous ones which emerge from local siting and decision making, and the exogenous ones, that are principally more regional and global in scope. The motivation in studying the Porto Marghera industrial park derives from its long and articulated history, its important economic role both at national and European levels, the complexity of the industries involved, the heavy environmental burden, and the high social conflict in the area. The aforementioned factors motivates our interest and indicates reasons for areas' eventual decline. We conclude that since 2004, had, either the endogenous factors or the exogenous ones – that influence the European or even global chemical industry, been favorable at the same time, there may have been an opportunity to stem the decline of the area. But without a strong basis the eco-industrial park faces a bleak future. We contribute to the literature a case study of the failure of a particular location to sustain its previously successful eco-industrial activity. Whether the fate of Porto Marghera should be seen as the natural outcome of a confluence of events over time, or as an outright failure, is discussed as a means of informing other industrial symbiosis projects.},

The underlying theory for the assessment of cooperative interactions is game theory, which supports the resolution of problems with strategic choices.

The model integrates the waste streams of mining industries in the Kola Peninsula in such a way that waste from one industrial operator becomes raw material for another. Using a counterfactual method, this article determines the eco-efficiency of the model between the years 1985 and 2005. A parallel study of the eco-efficiency of the actual system, i.e. in the absence of complex utilization, is then performed for the same time period. The study shows that complex utilization would indeed have yielded increased eco-efficiency, even though not all environmentally harmful emissions would have decreased. As a result of market collapse and the use of upstream pollution prevention together with traditional end-of-pipe technologies, however, the actual system shows net emission reductions similar to those modeled in complex utilization. It is suggested that in systems like the mining industry of the Kola Peninsula, with high production volumes and poorly developed environmental technologies, upstream pollution prevention together with traditional end-of-pipe technologies may prove more attractive than industrial symbiosis, despite the substantial increases in eco-efficiency of the latter.},

To better understand its value-creating potential, we analyzed firm- and policy-level environmental and economic outcomes for 313 industrial symbiosis exchanges across the United Kingdom, during a period of increasing environmental taxation and regulation. We found that, 1) exchanges involving larger volumes of material resources are more likely to create firm- and policy-level value; 2) firms with prior industrial symbiosis experience are more likely to create firm-level value; and, 3) exchanges involving dedicated waste firms are more likely to create policy-level value, although somewhat less likely to create firm-level value. Extending prior work on intra-firm action research, we show how firms can also create value through interfirm industrial symbiosis collaborations in response to regulatory constraints. We develop a deeper understanding of the types of outcomes likely to occur from industrial symbiosis exchanges, and detail firm- and policy-level implications and questions for future research.},

The program has just passed its ten-year anniversary. This study aims to assess the economic and environmental performance of the 17 accredited sector-integrated national demonstration eco-industrial parks. A selected group of ten metrics, including resource consumption, economic development, and waste emissions, are applied to assess the performance by comparing the difference of metrics between reference years of eco-industrial park planning and accreditation. The main findings include: (1) industrial added value of the 17 eco-industrial parks as a whole increased by 56\%; (2) for comprehensive energy consumption, fresh water consumption, industrial wastewater generation, and solid waste production, the 17 eco-industrial parks had an overall increase of 20\%, 18\%, 12\%, and 6\%, respectively. The quantity of energy and fresh water consumption, wastewater and solid waste generation in some eco-industrial parks started to decrease with economic growth. Meanwhile, the average intensity of the four metrics decreased by 22\%, 25\%, 28\%, and 32\%, respectively; (3) for chemical oxygen demand and sulfur dioxide, the eco-industrial parks accomplished a two-fold decrease in both total quantity of emissions and intensity. Chemical oxygen demand emissions and its intensity decreased by 25\% and 52\%, respectively. Sulfur dioxide emissions and its intensity decreased by 51\% and 69\%m respectively. Measures supporting the performance improvement of Chinese national demonstration eco-industrial parks are also discussed, which mainly include cleaner production and environmental management, infrastructure sharing, energy-saving practices at the firm level, the pillar industries, and industrial symbiosis.},

	abstract = {In this study, we proposed eco-efficiency indicator as an integral parameter for simultaneously quantifying the economic and environmental performance of industrial symbiosis (IS) networks. Based on the World Business Council for Sustainable Development definition of eco-efficiency, the eco-efficiency indicators proposed include one economic indicator, and three generally applicable simplified environmental indicators (raw material consumption, energy consumption, and CO2 emission). Three eco-efficiencies corresponding to three environmental indicators are assessed using seven IS networks that were developed between 2007 and 2012, which are currently operational in Ulsan Eco-Industrial Park (EIP), South Korea. Our results indicate that the eco-efficiency of individual IS networks improved up to 28.7\%. Besides, the evolution of seven IS networks comprising 21 companies resulted in an overall eco-efficiency enhancement of about 10\%. The proposed eco-efficiency indicators for IS networks can be easily utilized to communicate with decision makers at any level to assist in transforming conventional industrial complexes to EIP. The implications of the study and limitations of the methodology are delineated.},

	abstract = {Abstract The location of agricultural activities in favourable geographic areas has led to the development of local agglomerations of companies, recognised as agri-food clusters (AFCs). AFCs are characterised by typical environmental problems such as changes in land use, CO2 emissions, energy and water consumption, and chemical pollution. Recent technological changes in the agri-food industry have influenced the economic and social development of AFCs towards progressive industrialization. Such changes have also been the source of new environmental problems, such as those related to the large-scale use and disposal of auxiliary materials. Industrial Ecology (IE) proposes approaches and applied solutions to reduce the environmental impacts and improve the competitiveness of production activities. Major applications of IE in AFCs currently involve the valorisation of animal and vegetable by-products and scraps. Further improvements can be achieved by adopting IE-based solutions focused on auxiliary material wastes. This article analyses the potential development of IE-based approaches in a representative Italian AFC. Empirical evidence shows that efficient solutions can be implemented through material substitution, repair, and recycling, and by exploiting collaborative strategies among the agri-food and industrial companies established in the area.},

	abstract = {Industrial symbiosis (IS) emerged as a self-organizing business strategy among firms that are willing to cooperate to improve their economic and environmental performance. The adoption of such cooperative strategies relates to increasing costs of waste management, most of which are driven by policy and legislative requirements. Development of IS depends on an enabling context of social, informational, technological, economical and political factors. The power to influence this context varies among the agents involved such as the government, businesses or coordinating entities. Governmental intervention, as manifested through policies, could influence a wider range of factors; and we believe this is an area which is under-researched. This paper aims to critically appraise the waste policy interventions from supra-national to sub-national levels of government. A case study methodology has been applied to four European countries i.e. Denmark, the UK, Portugal and Switzerland, in which IS emerged or is being fostered. The findings suggest that there are commonalities in policy instruments that may have led to an IS enabling context. The paper concludes with lessons learnt and recommendations on shaping the policy context for IS development.},

As one of the first and the best-known eco-town projects, Kawasaki Eco-town was chosen as a case study area. First, the current industrial symbiosis practices in this area are introduced. To evaluate the potential of reducing the total CO2 emission through industrial symbiosis, alternative industrial symbiosis scenarios are then designed based on a questionnaire survey of 57 major local industries, to which 35 companies appropriately responded. The main focus of this paper is to calculate the total CO2 emission for different scenarios by adopting a life cycle CO2 analysis method. We then present recommendations on further improvement with consideration of the local realities. Our findings are that industrial symbiosis practices in Kawasaki Eco-town still have room for improvement in that greenhouse gas emissions can be further reduced and natural resources conserved through effective material exchanges, not only between companies, but also with the surrounding area. To encourage material exchanges between the municipality and industry, the city government should introduce a detailed separation program for garbage collection so that wastes can be effectively reused. In addition, the Waste Disposal and Public Cleaning Law needs amending so that industries can effectively use municipal solid waste in their manufacturing.},

	abstract = {Abstract The emergence of environmental and sustainability regulations, such as Kyoto protocol, Energy Policy Act and the increasingly limited availability of fossil fuels has brought the notion of gradually substituting petroleum products with bioethanol into the limelight. Even though, bioethanol is one of the cleanest sources of energy, a major concern of bioethanol production is its economic feasibility. Industrial symbiosis is one of the sustainable strategies that can help to reduce bioethanol production and logistic costs. In industrial symbiosis, traditionally separate plants collocate in order to efficiently utilize resources, reduce wastes and increase profits for the entire industrial symbiosis and each player in the industrial symbiosis. This paper focuses on developing optimal configurations of bioenergy-based industrial symbiosis under certain constraints, such that the bioethanol production cost (or profit) is reduced (or increased). A decision framework that combines the Linear Programming models and large scale Mixed Integer Linear Programming model is proposed to determine the optimal configuration of bioenergy-based industrial symbiosis and to design the optimal network flows of various products in the bioenergy-based industrial symbiosis. A case study has been conducted to study the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed model and the results suggest significant increase in profitability for biorefinery plant and the rest of the players in the bioenergy-based industrial symbiosis system. Sensitivity analysis is also conducted to provide deep understanding of the proposed bioenergy-based industrial symbiosis system and to identify the factors that might impact the performance of biorefinery plant in bioenergy-based industrial symbiosis.},

	abstract = {Abstract Industrial park development has become a critical strategy to promote economic development in many countries since 1980s. Particularly, China is one key country to adopt such a method on enhancing its industrialization. However, rapid industrial park development has resulted in many issues, including resource depletion, environmental emissions and pressure on responding climate change. Industrial symbiosis has been proved that it has positive impacts on promoting resource utilization efficiency. Therefore, effective performance evaluation can help recognize the key barriers on industrial symbiosis of industrial parks so that more appropriate policies can be raised by considering the local realities. Emergy synthesis is one feasible method on addressing the contribution of local ecosystem to industrial park development due to its innovative perspectives and mature methodology, while impact, population, affluence, technology (IPAT) formula and index decomposition analysis (IDA) are suitable for identifying and quantitatively calculating the key impacts of various factors. This paper integrated emergy synthesis, IPAT formula and IDA methods together to investigate the impact factors of industrial symbiosis in an industrial park. A case study approach at Dalian Economic Development Area (DEDA) was carried out so that such an effort can be tested. The results show that waste reutilization by industrial symbiosis in DEDA increased by 3.0E+20 seJ from 2006 to 2010. Technological pressure for waste utilization by industrial symbiosis and energy structure of an industrial park had made negative effects on the waste reutilization from 2006 to 2010 in DEDA, while the efficiency of non-renewable energy consumption and emergy scale of an industrial park played positive effects on the waste reutilization. Among the four impact factors, technological pressure for waste utilization and the efficiency of non-renewable energy consumption took more significant impacts on the industrial symbiosis of DEDA than the other two factors, which contributed −1.92E+21 seJ and 2.18E+21 seJ for the waste reutilization by industrial symbiosis respectively.},

The main objectives of this review are to introduce how Korea established its own approach to nationwide eco-industrial development and to examine the program's successes and limiting factors to draw lessons about how industrial symbiosis can be developed successfully elsewhere. The Korean EIP program emerged from a context of 50 years of industrial development to transform traditional industrial structures into EIPs using cleaner production at the industrial park level. During the first five years, regional EIP centers established at five pilot sites developed and implemented 47 resource-sharing projects, which generated considerable economic and environmental benefits. This was possible due to an institutional system that effectively combined top-down and bottom-up approaches and to the mediating role of regional EIP centers, which bring together local stakeholders from businesses, governments, and research organizations. By learning during the first phase, Korea has established its own model for eco-industrial development that will continue to develop during the second and third phases.},

The goal of the paper is to analyze in depth the process of exergy cost formation of flows within a system, which change when it is integrated with other systems, by using two complimentary approaches. First, a strategy based on irreversibility of the different components and effects of waste internalization already developed is applied for the first time to an example of Industrial Symbiosis. Second, a new method tracing the origin of the different resources consumed by the system is developed. This approach is very interesting for Industrial Symbiosis examples, characterized by a diversity of resources. A system composed of a coal-fired power plant, a cement kiln and a gas-fired boiler operating in isolated and integrated fashion is analyzed by using both presented approaches.},

The model comprises of (1) the structure of the ecosystem, (2) the classification of the enterprises as producers, consumers and decomposers, (3) mass and energy flows and (4) types of interactions. The classification of the enterprises introduced here as well as the analysis of mass and energy flows indicates that the diversity of the enterprises in eco-industrial parks is desired. Furthermore, the minimal condition to create the symbiotic relationships between the enterprises is established, claiming that at least one industrial producer or decomposer must be involved in the eco-industrial park.

Technology is important to support symbiosis, but few studies in China have focused on this topic at the industrial park level. This research presented a case study in a national iron and steel industrial park in China. Focus was given onto carbon mitigation through industrial symbiosis technology using substance flow analysis (SFA). Three typical iron and steel industry technologies, including coke dry quenching (CDQ), combined cycle power plant (CCPP), and CO2 capture by slag carbonization (CCSC) were evaluated with SFA. Technology assessment was further conducted in terms of carbon mitigation potential and unit reduction cost. Compared with the Business as usual (BAU) scenario, application with CDQ, CCPP, and CCSC reduced the net carbon emissions by 56.18, 134.43, and 222.89 kg CO2 per ton crude steel inside the industrial parks, respectively, including both direct and indirect emissions. Economic assessment revealed that the unit costs for the three technologies were also high, thereby necessitating national financial support. Finally, relevant policy suggestions and future concerns were proposed and discussed.},

As an emerging field, IE has grappled with challenges such as establishing itself as a unique field, gaining academic merit, developing quality standards, and guiding applications in industrial operations. Within the context of such challenges, distinct research branches have emerged: conceptual framework studies, development of operational tools (e.g. design for environment), and systemic studies (e.g. industrial symbiosis). The field began by conceptualizing industrial systems and has now made the transition to gathering the data that characterize such systems.

This article includes data from six of these EIP development projects. Three of the projects discussed are located in the Netherlands and three in the US. This article compares the differences in project approach and results on a national level. The approach suggested is derived from the available EIP development literature. Initial research indicates that the Dutch EIP projects are more successful than their US counterparts. This difference in success can be, mostly, attributed to the fact that the US projects are initiated by local and regional governments that see the project as a way to improve the local/regional economy with access to substantial government funds. Because of this heavy government involvement, US companies are, in general, not interested in the project. The more Successful Dutch projects, on the other hand, are mostly initiated by the companies themselves with financial and advisory support from the local and regional government.

	abstract = {Abstract Industrial ecosystems improve eco-efficiency at the system level through optimizing material and energy flows, which however raises a concern for system resilience because efficiency, as traditionally conceived, not necessarily promotes resilience. By drawing on the concept of resilience in ecological systems and in supply chains, resilience in industrial ecosystems is specified on the basis of a system's ability to maintain eco-efficient material and energy flows under disruptions. Using a network model that captures supply, asset, and organizational dependencies and propagation of disruptions among firms, the resilience, and particularly resistance as an important dimension of resilience, of two real industrial ecosystems and generalized specifications are examined. The results show that an industrial ecosystem is less resistant and less resilient with high inter-firm dependency, preferentially organized physical exchanges, and under disruptions targeted at highly connected firms. An industrial ecosystem with more firms and exchanges is less resistant, but has more eco-efficient flows and potentials, and therefore is less likely to lose its function of eco-efficiency. Taking these determinants for resilience into consideration improves the adaptability of an industrial ecosystem, which helps increase its resilience.},

	abstract = {In order to stabilize the global climate, the world's governments must make significant commitments to drastically reduce global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. One of the most promising methods of curbing GHG emissions is a world transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy. Solar photovoltaic (PV) cells offer a technically sustainable solution to the projected enormous future energy demands. This article explores utilizing industrial symbiosis to obtain economies of scale and increased manufacturing efficiencies for solar PV cells in order for solar electricity to compete economically with fossil fuel-fired electricity. The state of PV manufacturing, the market and the effects of scale on both are reviewed. Government policies necessary to construct a multi-gigaWatt PV factory and complementary policies to protect existing solar companies are outlined and the technical requirements for a symbiotic industrial system are explored to increase the manufacturing efficiency while improving the environmental impact of PV. The results of the analysis show that an eight-factory industrial symbiotic system can be viewed as a medium-term investment by any government, which will not only obtain direct financial return, but also an improved global environment. The technical concepts and policy limitations to this approach were analyzed and it was found that symbiotic growth will help to mitigate many of the limitations of PV and is likely to catalyze mass manufacturing of PV by transparently demonstrating that large-scale PV manufacturing is technically feasible and reaches an enormous untapped market for PV with low costs.},

Previous research on the metabolic processes for the elements that flow through eco-industrial parks has mainly accounted for the flows, stocks, and utilization efficiency of a few elements, but few studies have analyzed the complex internal characteristics of these metabolic processes by combining their structural and functional attributes. In this study, we analyzed the delivery and transformation processes and the internal characteristics of the industrial metabolic processes for sulfur in the Lubei eco-industrial park. By using network analysis, we were able to analyze the structural and functional characteristics of this network from the perspective of nodes (members of the network) and paths (flows between the nodes), and by combining an assessment of the characteristics of the nodes (degree, betweenness, closeness) and the paths (flow quantities and directions), we identified the key node (the cement clinker production), peripheral nodes (the ammonia and power plants), and key paths in the network (from the sulfuric acid plant to the ammonium phosphate plant, from the cement clinker production to the sulfuric acid plant, and from the ammonium phosphate plant to the cement clinker production). These results reveal the advantages and disadvantages of the Lubei eco-industrial park in terms of its structure and function, and suggest ways to improve the efficiency and the sustainable development of the park.},

	abstract = {In the race against climate change, aiming for low-carbon competitiveness, Flanders has initiated a carbon neutrality strategy on industrial parks, building towards energy efficient buildings and processes, acting as a stimulus for the production and consumption of green electricity. However, premises and internal process optimisation on industrial parks is not considered sufficient to limit greenhouse emissions in Flanders. Structural transition is called for, aiming for industrial clustering and energy autonomy based on renewables. Therefore, the concept of industrial symbiosis is analysed to determine how it could improve the energy-related carbon management on industrial parks. This article explores the literature on industrial symbiosis and eco-industrial parks searching for specific energy strategies, and is illustrated with case studies. Energy management on industrial parks can be integrated in the entire development process and park management. Maximising efficiency is a promising local optimisation issue, in which business should be engaged, stimulated and facilitated. By clustering buildings and processes, by energy exchange, collective production and joint contracting of energy services, local synergies can be intensified. Yet, uncertainty and variability in time of energy consumption can keep developers from tailoring industrial park design and utilities. Instead flexibility and solidity could be gained, and the offer of business space could be diversified, supported by a persevering issuing procedure to join similar and matching energy profiles. Energy management on industrial parks in Flanders has only recently started but is expected to gain professionalism. However further research is needed on this flexible design and thermal planning.},

In an industrial ecosystem, a group of industries are inter-connected through mass and energy exchanges for mutual benefits. However, some mass and energy exchange activities may cause unexpected environmental impacts. Therefore, it is vital to evaluate the environmental impacts of the symbiosis in order to provide a clear guidance for the decision-makers and stakeholders. The agro-chemical complex in the Lower Mississippi River Corridor with thirteen chemical and petrochemical industries emits huge amount of carbon dioxide. A bi-level design methodology is used to reconfigure this complex for utilizing surplus carbon dioxide. By using a superstructure-based approach, a new design scheme for this industrial ecosystem is proposed. In this paper, an LCA-type environmental impact assessment of different design schemes for this complex is conducted using the software TRACI, a tool developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). This analysis compares various environmental impacts of different designs and identifies the potential trade-offs in different environmental impact categories.

Our existing socio-technical systems should transition or evolve towards achieving systems sustainability.

Such applications of agent-based modeling can show possible evolutionary trajectories of given scenarios under different conditions and geographical contexts. In this paper we view these economic activities along with their associated partners (suppliers, customers, government agencies etc) and the natural environment in which they operate to be complex adaptive systems. Therefore, industrial eco-parks organized around agricultural products and the pulp and paper industries are relevant areas of application for ABM. This task will help identify and provide a contextual analysis of the structural factors and main driving forces for the development of industrial symbiosis along the lines of prospective scenarios (ecological constraints; regulations, economic, cultural and behavioural contexts; carbon markets; technological routes, etc). The current model focuses on the cultural and behavioral aspects with the following research question: What are the behavioral factors that favor the development of an industrial symbiosis?.},

	abstract = {Abstract Solutions towards sustainable cities are of vital importance for China's stakeholders due to the rapid urbanizations, serious resources depletion and environmental contaminations in China. China as the second largest economy is suffering from the dilemma of rapid industrialization and urbanization, and sustainable development. One of the most severe problems affecting China's sustainable urban development is the resource dependent city, in which resource mining and process industries dominate the local economy. With the depletion of natural resources and the degradation of environment, the concept of sustainability and economy transition solutions become more and more important. Under this condition, this study aims to conduct a comprehensive review on the major projects for a more sustainable future in China's national resource dependent cities and propose a countermeasure for the sustainability transition based on the industrial symbiosis concept. Firstly, an investigation on the panoramic view, challenges, transiting policies of China's resource dependent cities' project has been carried out. Subsequently, Guiyang city in Guizhou province of China, as a typical resource dependent city, has been chosen as example of industrial and regional symbiosis focusing on the integration and symbiosis of coal, electricity, aluminum, phosphor chemical, iron/steel industry and urban. Then, a quantitative assessment on the environmental benefits has been conducted based on material flow analysis approach. Results highlight a dramatic resource saving, solid waste reduction and carbon dioxide emission mitigation, as well as generating revenue for companies and local business opportunities. Finally, policy implications for promoting the industry symbiosis are discussed in details. Our research provides an efficacious solution for the transition of resource dependent cities, and it is revelatory for future sustainable urban planning and policy making in China.},

A novel disjunctive fuzzy optimisation approach is introduced to determine the optimum pathways based on processing plants' declared interests. In cases where any processing plant's interest is not satisfied, that party can elect to withdraw from the BBIS scheme; such decisions are reflected via disjunctive fuzzy optimisation. The optimum network configuration with the maximum economic performance can be determined based on the proposed approach, and individual interests of participating owners are equitably satisfied within mutually agreed bounds.

Based on current energy consumption and industrial symbiosis and the application of HPIMO model, scenarios related to industrial symbiosis, including waste plastics recycling, scrap tires recycling, flying ash recycling and biomass utilization are explored. Results show that compared with business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, IS can reduce solid wastes and further contribute to the co-benefits of energy saving, CO2 emissions reduction and air pollutants reduction.

Different approaches such as mathematical programming, pinch analysis and game theory have been used to identify the optimal network designs, which can simultaneously reduce the utilization of freshwater resources and the generation of wastewater streams. Since water exchange in an EIP involves multiple independently operating plants, information exchange between the participants is not completely transparent and multiple future scenarios are expected to happen as the fate and plans of other participants are not completely divulged. These future scenarios may bring about changes in the capacity or characteristic of industrial processes and may also involve the entry of additional companies and the closure of previously operating ones. Such aspects have not been fully addressed in previous studies. A robust optimization model is thus developed in this work to determine the optimal network design which can effectively operate in anticipation of multiple probable scenarios.

The Waste Strategy for England and Wales emphasises the need to reduce the amount of waste produced through the adoption of waste minimisation methodology. Waste minimisation clubs have been a key element in the UK programme to introduce more sustainable practice into industry and commerce. Northamptonshire, a county in the East Midlands of England, has benefited from 20 waste minimisation/resource efficiency projects, within a county programme, that have run between 1997 and 2004. This is the largest number in any county in England. This has been possible because of the formation of a large and inclusive partnership that contains all the key Local and Regional players. Performance Indicators have been developed to direct the county programme as it strives to introduce more sustainable waste management practice. The Northamptonshire model has led to a catalysed uptake of sustainable waste management practice in some 574 companies, some 13.4\% of participating companies in England in same period, thereby contributing to the maintenance of stable levels of economic activity. However, an inherent limit has been reached with waste minimisation club provision. Future provision for resource efficiency must include the movement towards Industrial Symbiosis (IS) and ultimately Industrial Ecology (IE). The radical shift towards IS and IE will occur as a response to the increased quantification of the resource flows, in a given UK economic area, and the deeper understanding of the diversity and complexity of the systems.

This study presents a process analysis approach that enables analysts to trace and structure the key activities that influence changes in an EIP system. This approach rests on five key activities that affect EIP changes and development: (1) institutional activity (2) technical facilitation (3) economic and financial enablers (4) informational activity and (5) company activity. Applying this lens to a Chinese EIP, Tianjin Economic-technological Development Area (TEDA), allowed us to build a structured database of activities to analyze its eco-transformation. In TEDA, institutional activity shapes the institutional arrangements that are pivotal for enabling and shaping the eco-transformation. Company activity has less influence on the system than the other key activities. Informational activity is vital to build trust and relationships. In a long time-span, TEDA transformed from a planned EIP to a planned and facilitated EIP, where the local authority acts as a coordinator and as a facilitator. The process analysis approach is amenable for an institutional environment other than the Chinese context because it results in a structured and documented analysis that is open to adjustment, expansion and critique.},

	abstract = {In a recent paper, a generic model, based on a multiobjective optimization procedure, for water supply system for a single company and for an eco-industrial park was proposed and illustrated by a park involving three companies A, B and C. The best configuration was identified by simultaneously minimizing the fresh water flow rate, the regenerated water flow rate and the number of connections in the eco-industrial park. The question is now to know what the maximal increase/decrease in pollutant flow rates is, so that the eco-industrial park remains feasible, economically profitable and environmentally friendly. A preliminary study shows that the park can accept an increase of pollutant flow rates of 29\% in company A, 12\% in company B and only 1\% in company C; beyond these limits the industrial symbiosis becomes not feasible. The proposed configuration is not flexible with a very limited number of connections. Indeed, the solution implemented for conferring some flexibility to this network is to increase the number of connections within the park. However, connections have a cost, so the increase of their number needs to remain moderate. The number of connections is augmented until the symbiosis becomes unfeasible, or until the gain for each company to participate to the park becomes lower than a given threshold. Several cases are studied by increasing the pollutant flow rates under two different scenarios: 1) in only one company, 2) in two or three companies simultaneously.},

	abstract = {The necessity to follow the rules of sustainable development in the everyday industrial practice has led to the formulation of the concept of an industrial ecosystem mimicking the natural ecosystem, since about fourteen years old. The core of industrial ecology, the industrial ecosystem model has become a framework for studying the interactions of the modern technological society with the environment. The Strategies for manufacturing an industrial ecosystem is a system, in which the consumption of energy and material is optimized, waste generation is minimized and the effluents of one process serve as the raw material for another process. The concept of an industrial ecosystem was based on the flows of materials through the life cycles, otherwise known as industrial symbiosis. In the present study, we propose the mathematical modeling of different industrial symbiosis material/energy. To achieve the following aims: maximizing of flows, reducing the distances between different firms, reducing the wastes treatment cost, reducing the equipment treatment costs and connecting costs, we adopt the formulation of objective function, in which we detailed the different constraints in order to obtain the optimal material/energy flows an industrial cluster.

	abstract = {Abstract Local Industrial Systems (LISes) are historically considered as one of the referential models for the socio-economic and technological development of a territory, widespread in European countries and especially in Italy. In recent years, some limits may be expressed mainly due to the persistent and growing global competition. Industrial Ecology (IE) proposes more sustainable models for the local development, mainly in the form of the so-called Eco-Industrial Parks (EIPs). This article analyses, in the framework of IE, the Ecologically Equipped Industrial Area (EEIA); introduced in 1998 by a national law, it currently represents the most significant model for the sustainable local industrial development in Italy. In the first part of the article, the place-based approaches to \{IE\} are described, highlighting the potential of the \{EIPs\} model and the delay in its diffusion within the Italian contexts. In the second part, the article examines the concept and the main features of the EEIAs, as defined by the national and regional regulations, and their role in the evolution of the \{LISes\} towards the \{EIP\} model. The results highlight that the main potential and limits of the \{EEIAs\} model are respectively related to i) the centralised management of the services, spaces and systems, the shared infrastructures and services within the area, and the administrative simplifications for the companies involved; ii) the long time investments returns, the regulatory limits related to the exchange of wastes, and an excessive inflexibility of the top-down approach followed in its development.},

	abstract = {Abstract This work presents an optimization-based negotiation framework for plants in an eco-industrial park (EIP). The framework combines the principles of rational allocation of benefits with the consideration of stability and robustness of the coalition to changes in cost assumptions by analyzing its stability threshold. The stability threshold allows stakeholders to make informed managerial decisions concerning the current or future plant interactions in an EIP. The proposed framework is presented via a palm oil eco-industrial park (PEIP) case study consisting of a biomass tri-generation system (BTS), palm-based biorefinery (PBB) and palm oil mill (POM). The results of the case study indicate that the deserving annual cost savings allocation for BTS, \{PBB\} and \{POM\} are 38\% (USD 2,100,000), 14\% (USD 800,000) and 48\% (USD 2,600,000) of the total annual cost savings respectively. Based on these allocations, the stability analysis determined that the \{PEIP\} coalition will stable as long as the symbiosis costs of BTS, \{PBB\} and \{POM\} fall within 37–46\%, 10–30\% and 20–25\% of their respective raw material costs. Otherwise, the stability of the \{PEIP\} coalition is compromised and further action can be taken as stipulated in the proposed framework.},

	abstract = {Abstract The concept of eco-industrial park (EIP) has recently become the subject of a great deal of attention from industry and academic research groups. This paper proposes a series of systematic approaches for multi-level modelling and optimisation in EIPs. The novelties of this work include, (1) building a four-level modelling framework (from unit level to process level, plant level and industrial network level) for \{EIP\} research, (2) applying advanced mathematical modelling methods to describe each level operation, (3) developing efficient methodologies for solving optimisation problems at different \{EIP\} levels, (4) considering symbiotic relations amongst the three networks (material, water and energy networks) at the top \{EIP\} level with the boundary conditions of economic, social and legal requirements. For methodology demonstration, two cases at process level and industrial network level respectively are tested and solved with the developed modelling and optimisation strategies. Finally, the challenges and applications in future \{EIP\} research are also discussed, including data collection, the extension of the current networks to EIPs, and the feasibility of the proposed methodologies for complex \{EIP\} problems. The extended \{EIPs\} include the combination of material exchanges, energy systems and waste-water treatment networks. The aspects considered for future industrial ecology are carbon emission, by-product reuse, water consumption, and energy consumption. The main object of this paper is to explain the detailed model construction process and the development of optimisation approaches for a complex \{EIP\} system. In future work, this system is expected to share services, utility, and product resources amongst industrial plants to add value, reduce costs, improve environment, and consequently achieve sustainable development in a symbiosis community.},

	abstract = {Abstract An Eco-Industrial Park (EIP) is composed of a number of Industrial Symbiosis (IS) instances, which allow energy/material exchanges among the different industrial enterprises (Individual Actors, IA) therein. By so doing, IA's economic and environmental performances can be improved. Despite recent methodological advancements, the existing approaches to \{EIP\} design optimization are still suffering from several major problems: (i) dominance of the global \{EIP\} optimum over the local \{IA\} optimum, (ii) limited number of optimization objectives falling into the categories of economic and environmental objectives and (iii) \{EIP\} optimization performed without considering possible operational uncertainties. In addition, the adoption of the bio-inspired concept of \{IS\} makes \{EIP\} evolve from classical engineered systems towards complex engineered systems, with associated static and dynamic complexity characteristics. To highlight and understand the complexity features of EIP, in this paper we present them as intelligent networks for multiple energy and material exchanges, drawing a parallel with another typical complex system, that of the electric power network, in its modern Smart Grid (SG) concept, conceived to improve and optimize the distribution and use of electrical energy. Then, the modelling and optimization framework proposed in this paper adopts a more systematic methodology for accounting of the \{EIP\} complexity characteristics and addressing the associated optimization challenges. The proposed approach allows ensuring a sustainable and robust \{EIP\} design, thanks to the due account given to the related uncertainties and risks, e.g., due to major changes in the regulatory context and \{IA\} operational strategies, failures of interconnections among IA, interruption or shutdown of \{IA\} operation.},

	abstract = {Abstract Eco-industrial parks provide a platform for the application of industrial symbiosis where the synergistic network of companies reuse portions of their by-products to reduce disposed waste, reduce environmental emissions, and improve plant efficiency. However, designing a complex network of material and energy exchanges between companies in an industrial park while satisfying multiple conflicting objectives require a systematic design methodology. In addition, strategic decision-making in an eco-industrial park involves the selection of prospective companies (i.e., support tenants), which complement the existing companies (i.e., anchor tenants). In this study, a fuzzy mixed-integer non-linear programming model is proposed to select prospective support tenants in an eco-industrial park while satisfying the product demand, minimizing the environmental footprint of the eco-industrial park, and also maximizing the annualized profit of each company in the eco-industrial park. A hypothetical but realistic case study involving an algae-based eco-industrial park is used to demonstrate the application of the model. The results demonstrate the selection of the appropriate support tenants for the algae-based eco-industrial park together with the optimal plant configuration. Sensitivity analysis is used to assess the performance of the algae-based eco-industrial park with respect to the changes in prices of the by-products. The developed model thus aid the planners of an eco-industrial park in assessing which among the prospective support tenants would best complements an existing anchor tenant. Furthermore, the model can also identify price negotiation points between tenants for some product streams which may show sensitivity on the plant capacity of each tenant.},

However, market changes and technological advancement could undermine the level of symbiosis during operations. In this research, the existing symbiosis indicators were identified and classified using a systematic literature review. The results demonstrated the necessity to achieve indicators sufficiently simple that brokers are enabled in confronting the monitoring and promotion of symbiosis. In this paper, an industrial symbiosis indicator is introduced that detects the variation of symbiosis over time and that provides a dynamic perspective of the eco-industrial parks. This indicator can be used in the underpinning of decisions and the provision of continuous improvement. It was evaluated in several theoretical scenarios created from real data. The three scenarios are: absence of symbiosis, presence of symbiosis, and perfect symbiosis. The results demonstrate consistency between the values of the indicator and changes in the scenarios. The industrial symbiosis indicator proposed was able to detect variations in symbiosis with simple measures, and could support managers in encouraging companies to actively engage in effort for more advanced levels of symbiosis. The concept of “environment impact momentum”, proposed and applied in this research, is a theoretical construct that could support a new class of indicators capable of identifying the dynamic behavior of eco-industrial parks.},

The park's success results from the harmonious and coordinated relationships among its members. Analyzing the ecological characteristics of these relationships and identifying the resulting advantages provide a basis for improving the park's efficiency and examining other parks. In this paper, we analyzed the flows of sulfur in the Lubei park (as an example of typical flows) using ecological network analysis to describe this industrial symbiosis system. The integrated analysis of the utility resulting from direct and indirect exchanges of byproducts and wastes can reflect the ecological relationships among members within the system. Based on these ecological relationships, members can be divided into producers, primary consumers, and secondary consumers; the integral flow weight for each level of the hierarchy can then be compared to reveal the system's overall ecological structure. By examining the exchanges of resources within the system, we can describe the ecological connotations of the symbiosis and how these ecological relationships influence the overall development and resource flows within the system.},

	abstract = {Abstract Chinese government promotes ecological civilization in the “13th five year planning” (2016–2020) period. As a result, ecological impacts become highlight in the national circular economy practices. To apply the eco-industrial development strategy to address the intertwined industrial and regional economic development, as well as related environmental and ecological challenges is key point. Urban industrial symbiosis provides a novel approach to realize the above expectation. Traditional evaluation on circular economy provided critical environmental insights, while to date, ecological evaluation has been rather few for urban industrial symbiosis promotion. With this circumstance, this paper developed an integrated material flows analysis (MFA) and emergy evaluation model to investigate the environmental and ecological benefits of urban industrial symbiosis implementation in one typical industrial city in China. Local oriented urban industrial symbiosis network was analyzed. Inter flows and related environmental benefits of symbiotic network were quantified with MFA, and further ecological impacts were evaluated with emergy approach and the designed emergy index. From the environmental perspective, results highlighted, in general, urban industrial symbiosis generated significant life cycle environmental benefits, especially the reduction of upstream resource mining and downstream waste disposal within the regional metabolism. In total, around 204.7 million tons ore mining, 6.9 million ton solid waste and 2.3 million tons \{CO2\} emissions were reduced per year. From the ecological perspective, total emergy input was reduced by 1.3 × 1022 sej, which reflected the reduction of ecological burden. Particularly, as a key indicator for ecological lost caused by pollution, dilution emergy was decreased by 2.5 × 1016 sej, resulting from carbon mitigation co-benefit of urban industrial symbiosis. This paper provided modeling approach to understand the ecological benefits and trade-offs of circular economy practices, and critical insights on regional eco-industrial development. It will shed a light on ecological civilization construction in China in the new national planning period.},

	abstract = {Abstract China's industrial parks have made great contributions to its economic growth with their rapid development. However, the resources and environment related issues have been challenging their sustainability to different degree. There still exist the following challenges in evaluating the sustainability of industrial systems due to the existing researches ignoring one or more related issues, including (1) ignorance of ecosystem's contributions to industrial activities, (2) neglect of quality differences between different resources, energies and labors, (3) involving subjectivity of human, (4) inadequate consideration of emissions' impact, and (5) lacking consideration on recycling and reuse benefit derived from industrial symbiosis. Therefore, they are isolated to some degree and lack completeness and systematization. This study aimed to deal with the five issues by adopting classic \{EA\} (emergy analysis) method (Overcoming issues 1–3.), quantifying emissions' impact in terms of emergy with some modified parameters (Addressing issue 4.) and proposing indicators to evaluating recycling and reuse benefit (Focusing on issue 5.). Then one proposed emergy method and the related indicator system for assessing the sustainability of industrial parks were set up. Next, an industrial park in Sichuan, China, as a case, was research using the proposed method and indicator system. The study results show that, according to the classic emergy based indicators, this industrial park has relatively high economic competition ability (EYR = 1.14), relatively low environmental press (ELR = 29.31), and relatively strong sustainability (ESI = 0.0388) compared to other industrial parks in China. However, its low economic efficiency and low wastes recycling/reuse degree still seriously challenge its sustainability with the local mineral resources exhaustion in the future. In terms of modified emergy indicators, emissions' impact further raises its environmental load by 3.42\% and reduces its sustainability level by 2.70\%.

However, quantitative analysis of economic and environmental consequence for \{IS\} activities is still rare, especially for chemical industrial parks in western China. Under such a circumstance, this study is aiming to shed light on the current \{IS\} activities in a typical chemical industrial park in western China, so as to quantitatively evaluate the environmental benefits and economic benefits of IS, including the benefits of each \{IS\} chain, the benefits of each participated industrial company and the total benefits of the whole \{IS\} network in Midong Chemical Industrial Park (MCIP). Results show that: the annual exchanged volume of undesired material from 32 \{IS\} activities in \{MCIP\} was more than 4.74 million tons per year, covering 19 different kinds of undesired materials and involving 18 industrial companies within MCIP. The top four exchanged materials were carbide slag, coal gangue, fly ashes and slag, with the exchanged volumes of 1.07, 0.97, 0.92 and 0.68 million tons per year, respectively. From the perspective of \{IS\} chains, \{IS\} chain number 1 (carbide slag exchange between Huatai Chemical Corp. and Tianshan Cement Corp.) gained the most environmental benefits, with more than 2 million tons and the most economic benefit of 154 million \{RMB\} (25.08 million \{US\} dollar) per year. From the perspective of industrial companies, Huatai Chemical Corp. received the most economic benefits, while Shenhua Thermal Power Plant and Tianshan Cement Corp. received the most environmental benefits. Totally, \{IS\} activities contributed 5.86 million tons of environmental benefits and 382.43 million \{RMB\} (62.29 million \{US\} dollar) of economic benefits to MCIP. In order to further promote \{IS\} in MCIP, several recommendations were proposed, such as increasing \{CE\} awareness and environmental awareness of all the stakeholders, restriction of virgin resources, encouragement of urban symbiosis, establishment of a functional information platform and improvement of CE-related technologies.},

In this regard, various strategies and projects have been adopted such as eco-industrial park development, low-carbon industrial park construction, circular economy industrial park. However, due to different levels of economic development and different operational system, the pathways of industrial parks towards sustainable development between developing country and developed country have differed. Their experiences and disadvantages should be explored by other countries in similar circumstances. This paper aims to fill such a gap by carrying out case studies between China and Canada, two countries identified as a rapidly developing country and a developed country. Both countries have encouraged to develop industrial parks to support economic development and have recently began to explore whether they can lead to sustainable industrial development. To support the analysis, Tianjin Economic Development area (TEDA), the largest industrial park in terms of its economic scale in China, and Burnside Industrial Park, which is one of the largest park in Canada, were selected as comparative case studies. Through the analysis on the adopted policies strategies and practices, the results indicate that China has put much more effort into their eco-industrial park due to the urgent situation of resource pressure and environmental pollution utilizing a top-down management system. Industrial parks in Canada appear to be moving more slowly in their adoption of sustainable development.},

The issues relevant to adapting an existing park differs from those associated with constructing a new park using eco-industrial principles. Published literature was surveyed for methodologies which identify and establish viable inter-company exchanges for water, heat, power and materials. Studies which address issues associated with infrastructure alterations are specifically highlighted, as well as methods to quantify and manipulate any potential financial and/or ecological benefits gained by adopting proposed eco-industrial measures. Additional topics, such as network analysis, company motivation, confidentiality issues and introduction of new industries or facilities are included. This review surveys current quantitative methodologies that can be applied to the process of adapting established industrial park networks into eco-industrial park systems and case studies which are pertinent to this type of adaptation.},

	abstract = {Abstract Industry plays as a double-edged sword that can contribute to both gross domestic product (GDP) and pollution, thus the concept of eco-industrial development which emphasize the environmental cleanness in economy development has received more and more attentions recently. Different from the traditional development mode which merely relocating industries outside of the cities for pursuing sustainable development, eco-industrial development makes significant innovation by treating or utilizing wastes (i.e. solid wastes and waste energy) in a smart way for local industries to achieve a win–win situation. In order to investigate the eco-benefits of eco-industrial development in China, this study focused on an industrial and urban symbiosis case of Guiyang city in which process synergy, municipal solid wastes recycling and waste energy utilization were incorporated in this typical industrial city. This city is resource-dependent, has many heavy industries, and these severely hinder sustainable development in this city. In order to promote eco-industrial development, an integrated coal, electricity, aluminum, phosphor chemical, iron/steel industry and urban symbiosis network was firstly designed, with linkages between various industries through energy exchanges and process synergies. Subsequently, a quantitative assessment on the life cycle environmental benefits were further conducted. Then, we found that a dramatic resource saving and carbon dioxide emission reduction can be achieved. Finally, some policy implications to address the barriers of promoting industrial and urban symbiosis were proposed. This study is critical for future industrial and urban planning policy making and shed a light on innovative eco-industrial development in China.},

In addition to water conservation within individual plants, wastewater can be reused/recycled among different companies through inter-plant water integration (IPWI) schemes. Such schemes are based on the concept of industrial ecology and industrial symbiosis, and can be used to achieve greater water savings than when water conservation is implemented in individual companies separately. However, in IPWI, each participating company seeks to maximise its own benefits. In the absence of centralised authority dictating the terms of water integration schemes, conventional modelling techniques are not appropriate. This paper shows how a game theory-based approach can be used to analyse the interaction of participating companies in an eco-industrial park seeking to develop an \{IPWI\} scheme.},

Existing researches concerning low carbon development of industrial park mainly focus on carbon accounting and carbon reduction strategies. Explanation of how the activities are designed and practiced according to characteristics of targeted industrial parks is limited. Thus, it is essential to have a close look at the low carbon innovation and practice in industrial park. In this study, low carbon practice in Caohejing Industrial Park is targeted as a case study. Low carbon development ideas and actions in the general scope and particular actions are respectively examined. In terms of the general scope, measures including optimization of the energy structure, transforming of infrastructure and auditing of energy consumption and \{GHG\} emission are found well practiced. As for the particular action, approaches of industry symbiosis and energy saving in the building sector are analyzed. The contribution of \{GHG\} emission reduction approaches in Caohejing Industrial Park is then evaluated. Our findings reveal that transparent accounting of \{GHG\} emissions is a basic work for carrying out low carbon measures. Energy structure optimization, infrastructure transforming are also essential steps in the general scope. The commonly applied industry symbiosis is found effective in promoting low carbon economy together with energy saving efforts in the building sector. The experience of regional industrial development in our research can offer reference for low carbon development of industrial parks in helping to make the necessary changes towards sustainable post fossil carbon societies.},

	abstract = {Abstract The environmental crisis affecting the Taranto provincial industrial district in Italy, centred around the Ilva steelworks, has made its existence within the surrounding contexts unsustainable. The application of industrial symbiosis principles in this district can certainly represent a purposeful means for a move towards a more sustainable industrial system. This work presents the results of a research project, funded by the Caripuglia Foundation, for a study of industrial symbiosis in the Taranto industrial district. The study of the district, which is characterized by the presence of heavy industries such as steelworks, oil refinery, cement industry and power stations with an energy consumption of 182.4 PJ/year, identified the industrial sectors and firms that could be involved in symbiotic activities and the spontaneous existing synergic interactions taking place among the largest firms of the district. The study has also quantified and illustrated the useful recycling, within various industrial sectors, of inefficiently used and disposed waste energy (44.6 PJ/year of heat) and material waste and by-products (3.28 Mt/year). Among the latter are steelworks slag, mill scale, spent refractories and coal fly ash. However, the study has revealed that, despite the presence of multiple anchor tenants on the territory, the industrial symbiosis is still implemented at a basic level. There are different constraints on the full development of the industrial symbiosis in the industrial district of Taranto. Among these, the focus of the entrepreneurs on their core business was the main one, while additional uses of the current waste are seen as a diversion of human resources and capital.},

	abstract = {Abstract The normative question “what role should governmental policy play to facilitate the development of industrial symbiosis?” has received considerable attention of researchers. However, for several reasons the effects of governmental policy actions on industrial symbiosis are still not clear. This article proposes a research agenda to clarify the mechanisms of policy intervention and facilitation of industrial symbiosis based on a comprehensive review of industrial symbiosis literature, focusing on how policy is conceptualized and studied. The results show that existing research lacks an explicit definition of policy, and employs a static conceptualization of policy that is reinforced by comparative statics research methods. We argue that a dynamic process perspective is crucial to reveal the actual mechanisms through which policy intervention and facilitation affect the evolution of industrial symbiosis. Building on this view, industrial symbiosis research is connected with insights from policy sciences, and the case of policy translation of Circular Economy and Eco-industrial Park in China is investigated in order to illustrate that policy is at heart a dynamic process. We conclude with a research agenda proposing that the key to reveal the mechanisms is to identify the sequence of events connecting policy process and industrial symbiosis practices.},

Exploring the evolution of \{IS\} is crucial to present a dynamic perspective of IS. This paper highlights the drivers and the mechanism of policies on the evolution of \{IS\} as well as the environmental benefits of IS. A backward approach that provides comprehending on how industrial network emerged over time was used to analyze the sequences of \{IS\} in a typical case study of an iron and steel industrial network from 1958 to 2012. Results show that symbiotic links increased from 2 to 75 over time, with the average number of symbiotic links per entities from 1 to 3.26. The main guiding factors in the evolution of industrial symbiosis are not only the interests of enterprises and knowledge of industrial symbiosis, but also related policies and regulations. Industrial symbiosis can improve carbon metabolism efficiency and avoid pollutants emissions. Exchange-based \{IS\} can avoid more carbon dioxide emission (CO2) than the other pollutants, and energy exchanges had a greater contribution to pollutants emission reduction than the solid waste/byproduct exchanges. The network structure and the evolution of \{IS\} can be understood better through considering not only the inter-firm level and the regional or global level but also the intra-firm level.},

	abstract = {Abstract In this paper we present the potential for small and medium sized enterprises grouped in industrial areas or parks for systemic eco-innovation through industrial symbiosis strategies. The study was carried out in an industrialised region in the self-governing region of Cantabria (Northern Spain), which comprises 161 inventoried firms, located in 9 different industrial areas. By sectors, 40\% work in commerce, the repair of motor vehicles, motorbikes and motorcycles and personal and domestic articles, 16\% in metallurgy and the manufacture of metallic products, 13\% in construction and the remaining 31\% work in such diverse sectors as real estate services, the paper industry, food and the chemical industry, among others. The information on resources and waste flows was collected by means of programmed visits, with a success rate of 104/161 enterprises. The preliminary results show opportunities both for substituting resources with waste products in real and virtual cases and for sharing waste management services and infrastructures. The diversity of synergetic opportunities is related to the number of enterprises that participate in each industrial area and with the occurrence of the types of waste products in the global system; thus we find options for action on different systemic levels. An optimistic scenario for escalating industrial symbiosis between small and medium sized enterprises is revealed from the project, thanks to both the companies' current behaviour and to the potential opportunities that were detected. This paper establishes the basis for advancing in subsequent stages of quantification and the evaluation of the feasibility of specific alternatives for turning the system under study into an industrial ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Abstract Industrial symbiosis (IS) has gained more attention in the production economics as the pressure on companies increases for the reduction of waste emissions and primary resources consumption. In fact, this has forced companies to provide other companies their wastes as primary resources and vice-versa. These supply circles lead to \{IS\} that can mitigate environmental impacts and costs in industrial areas (IA). The aim of this paper is to provide guidelines for the future evolution of \{IA\} operating on the basis of \{IS\} principles. Given a production network within an IA, perfect \{IS\} within the network is defined as a theoretical optimum for \{IS\} design where no primary resources is needed from outside and no wastes are discharged outside. Adopting an enterprise input–output approach, the conditions for a perfect \{IS\} are found for one-waste and multi-waste cases, and the distance between the states of the actual network and of the related perfect \{IS\} is measured. Proposed approach is empirically applied to Santa Croce sull'Arno industrial district of tannery where the recycling of chrome liquors, fleshing, and wastewater are investigated. Results show under which conditions perfect symbiosis is achievable for two waste types. Policy implications are also suggested for the design of \{IA\} when \{IS\} principles are adopted.},

	abstract = {Abstract The forest products industry generates several residues in addition to actual products and many of these residues such as fly ash generated by bioenergy production and sludge from the waste water purification processes can be used after being properly treated. This study focused on a hypothetical case in which fly ash from bioenergy production and sludge from forest products industry waste water treatment would be granulated and produced into a forest fertilizer. The Waste Policy of the European Union and growing focus on circular economy goals both support more efficient use of industrial waste and side products and is a major driver for companies towards better material efficiency. This study assessed the global warming potential (GWP) of a potential symbiosis product based on a hypothetical granulating process including two industrial residue streams and briefly examined the drivers of the \{EU\} and Finnish policy and legal frameworks for recycling of industrial residues and for their usage as secondary raw materials for potential symbiosis products. The results indicated that the production of 1000 kg of potential symbiosis granules in our model case produced \{GWP\} burdens of 11.75 (kg CO2-equiv.). As an example, the production of the already existing NPK-fertilizers produced a \{GWP\} burden of 1304.92 (kg CO2-equiv.). Our system boundary was the actual manufacturing process. We also compared different fertilizers based on their fertilizer effect including determination of the composition of the elements in relation to the commercial fertilizer composition. The results indicate that even if the amount of the granulated ash fertilizer was bigger, the amount of environmental burden it produced was much lower. Therefore, the production of the potential symbiosis product could have benefits in terms of \{GWP\} results and overall environmental performance when compared to use of primary raw materials.},

Therefore, a systematic design approach is needed to facilitate the successful implementation of these networks. However, the first step is to properly identify potential barriers (e.g., lack of effective communication, confidentiality issues, support services) to success. In this work, barriers to implementing \{IS\} in an industrial park are analyzed using Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMA℡). \{DEMA℡\} is an approach for identifying cause–effect relationships among several factors in order to understand the problem properly. The results from this study can then be used by stakeholders to create policies which focus on addressing the fundamental barriers towards forging sustainable \{IS\} networks.},

Thus, this paper proposes a review of the role of social media and social networks in order to analyze their ability to stimulate the initiation of industrial synergies. This analysis provides a framework for creating a Web-based industrial synergy support system based on social network-style functionality. For industrial companies and their key stakeholders, this might serve as a system that helps forge partnerships and connections with like-minded others, and ultimately helps discover material flow compatibilities. It could also help post and distribute related information for an entire industry, which could improve the dissemination of knowledge related to industrial ecology. Finally, \{GSN\} could provide researchers interested in exploring the potential of social networks with a new and rich research domain, while bridging both online and offline connections between personal and business sectors.},

	abstract = {Despite the fact that all successful, documented cases of industrial symbiosis to this day have been self-organizing, some authors and development officials have suggested that increased public planning might deliver better results in this respect than spontaneously evolved market coordination. This paper takes an historical approach to suggest that comprehensive planning is unlikely to live up to the expectations of its proponents. The essay is structured as follows. The first section provides short case studies of industrial symbiosis in highly different economic and institutional settings, the essentially free-market regime of Victorian England and communist Hungary (1948–1989). The available evidence suggests that market coordination proved much more favorable to the emergence of industrial symbiosis, despite the elaboration of a comprehensive policy to that effect in Hungary. Insights derived from the so-called “Austrian” critique of central planning are then used to explain this paradox. The analysis presented suggests that the Hungarian planners' failure was not so much the result of the bad implementation of sound policies, but the logical outcome of a top-down approach's shortcomings. Policy implications for the public planning of industrial symbiosis in a mixed economy are then derived and the case for self-organization is found more compelling. The creation of more innovative institutions that will force firms to “internalize their externalities” while leaving them the necessary freedom to innovate is viewed as an urgently needed and promising path towards increased, sustainable reuse of industrial by-products.},

	abstract = {Abstract This paper explores geospatial industrial diversity and its influence on the brokerage of industrial symbiosis working agreements (otherwise known as synergies). Research conducted in 2011 concluded that within third-party brokered resource exchanges between two or more normally unrelated companies, the industrial diversity of a given geographic area was the primary driver behind how far a material travels from its point of origin to its point of reuse. This conclusion was largely derived from intuition and the elimination of other widely discussed drivers or limitations to symbiotic resource movement (e.g., mental distances, resource value and/or the physical characteristics of a resource). The presented article sets out to empirically test this suggestion by mapping the geospatial industrial diversity of England and comparing it to the movement of resources within synergies facilitated by the National Industrial Symbiosis Programme (NISP). Among other results, it was established that there are correlations between geospatial industrial diversity and the distance materials move in addition to the number of synergy types and the replication of synergies facilitated within a given area. It was found that 76\% of synergies were facilitated within areas of high (upper 10\% of values) contiguous diversity, areas of high ‘species' richness possessed a greater variety of synergies, and areas of high synergy replication were areas of high ‘species' population evenness. Based on a sensitivity analysis of diversity indices and diversity mapping techniques, it was concluded that high ‘species' richness provided the greatest opportunities for realising local industrial symbiosis.},

Industrial symbiosis networks are framed as complex adaptive systems and an agent-based model is provided, to study the effect of the proposed contract on their emergence. In particular, we utilize a real case study and by means of simulation assess the benefits associated with the proposed contract in terms of emergence of stable industrial symbiosis relationships. The results show that the proposed contractual mechanism is a facilitator for establishing symbiotic relationships especially in scenarios characterized by low environmental uncertainty and high turbulence.},

It has been successfully applied in industrial ecology, in which localized phenomena of industrial symbiosis have been a key focus, and where metrics from both the social and natural sciences are used to understand socio-metabolic structures. In this paper we classify such studies as Social-Material Network Analyses and we discuss the body of work, drawing on network analyses from various disciplines. A challenge is the hierarchical nature of industrial networks and how it can be addressed socially.

	abstract = {Abstract Industrial symbiotic networks are based on the principles of ecological systems where waste equals food, to develop synergistic networks. For example, industrial symbiosis (IS) at Kalundborg, Denmark, creates an exchange network of waste, water, and energy among companies based on contractual dependency. Since most of the industrial symbiotic networks are based on ad-hoc opportunities rather than strategic planning, gaining insight into disruptive scenarios is pivotal for understanding the balance of resilience and sustainability and developing heuristics for designing resilient \{IS\} networks. The present work focuses on understanding resilience as an emergent property of an \{IS\} network via a network-based approach with application to the Kalundborg Industrial Symbiosis (KIS). Results from network metrics and simulated disruptive scenarios reveal Asnaes power plant as the most critical node in the system. We also observe a decrease in the vulnerability of nodes and reduction in single points of failure in the system, suggesting an increase in the overall resilience of the \{KIS\} system from 1960 to 2010. Based on our findings, we recommend design strategies, such as increasing diversity, redundancy, and multi-functionality to ensure flexibility and plasticity, to develop resilient and sustainable industrial symbiotic networks.},

This concept and its application have also been the topic of extensive research. Up till now, this work lacks a more comprehensive theoretical framework, and this paper fills this gap. We provide a theoretical basis for understanding the dynamics through which regional industrial systems change their connectiveness in an attempt to reduce their ecological impact. We position our framework within the field of industrial symbiosis based on a comprehensive literature search in the \{ISI\} Web of Science database for publications that listed ‘industrial symbiosis', ‘eco-industrial park', or a combination of ‘industrial-ecology' and ‘regional' as a topic. The framework conceptualizes industrial symbiosis as a process at two levels: (1) the level of the regional industrial system (RIS), and (2) the societal level where the concept and routines of industrial symbiosis diffuse. We link the dynamics at these levels to changes in ecological impact and increase in institutional capacity. We conclude with a research agenda based on the variables and their basic relationships specified in our framework. The main line of research we propose is to systematically investigate how institutional capacity evolves over time in regional industrial systems and how it affects the ecological impact of such systems. We also propose to investigate how insights from existing literature about stimulating and impeding factors to industrial symbiosis can be understood in terms of mechanisms of transmission and how these mechanisms interact to create nationally distinct patterns of diffusion of industrial symbiosis.},

Using this method, both energy and material flows on both the supply and the demand side can be studied simultaneously. The method can be used to find improvements in the structure of the modelled system, to find the optimal operational strategy of a given system, and to evaluate and compare different systems. The total system costs for stand-alone cases and integrated industrial symbiosis system configuration are compared, generating results that can be used as decision support when planning industrial symbiosis initiatives in the forest industry. The results of this study showed that there are financial benefits to industrial symbiosis compared to the same system operated in stand-alone mode, and that the industrial symbiosis configuration generates a more stable system. However, it is difficult to generalize the results from a case study, and the main conclusion drawn is that it is possible to show that industrial symbiosis has economical benefits, although the magnitude of these benefits needs to be evaluated from case to case.},

We develop two multi-regression models using questionnaire survey data from recycling facilities and cross-sectional data from 23 Eco-Towns to analyze the amount of waste treated by and the operating rate of recycling facilities. Dependent variables are introduced through a review of the literature on industrial symbiosis and the situation of Japanese Eco-Towns, focusing on three necessary features: recycling boundaries, government policy intervention, and local collaboration and partnership. The results of two simple regression models of recycling facilities in Eco-Towns offer several fruitful insights that aid in understanding the performance of recycling projects. First, recycling facilities' geographical proximity to users of recycled products can contribute to high operating rates. Second, subsidies for constructing facilities do not improve recycling projects' operating rates. Third, collaboration, rather than competition, among recycling facilities can improve their operating rates.},

	abstract = {It is widely acknowledged that China's economic miracle has been achieved at the expense of its natural capital and environment. In order to deal with this problem, the circular economy (CE) has been chosen as a national policy for sustainable development. National laws and regulations have been enacted to facilitate the implementation of CE and national CE demonstration projects have been initiated such that national benchmarking activities could be completed. China is the first country to release nationally focused CE indicators so that objective and credible information on the status of CE implementation can be recognized. These CE indicators are valuable metrics for policy and decision-makers and can help achieve CE goals and outcomes. This unique indicator system has not been communicated to international communities. This paper aims to more broadly introduce this unique national CE indicator system. China's CE efforts are first detailed with various provisions of the national indicator system. A critical analysis of such an indicator system is presented. We show that certain benefits can be gained, but substantive revision is also needed due to the lack of a comprehensive set of sustainability indicators which should include social, business indicators, urban/industrial symbiosis, absolute material/energy reduction, and prevention-oriented indicators. Concerns related to barriers on implementation are also presented in this paper. The knowledge gained from Chinese efforts on CE indicators are valuable to both developed and developing nations seeking to implement sustainable development measures within their regulatory policies.},

	abstract = {Abstract The use of process integration (PI) tools in industrial ecology (IE) applications, particularly industrial symbiosis (IS), can lead to greater sustainability gains than is possible for single plants or companies. Such integration is facilitated by the advent of eco-industrial parks (EIPs) which use geographic clustering to promote sustainable exchange of materials and energy streams among different plants and companies. In particular, PI methods have been developed for total site integration and successfully implemented in documented industrial cases. However, one aspect of interplant integration is not easily done using classical PI methods, since each potential partner company will participate in a symbiosis scheme specifically with the motivation of increasing its own profits. The self-interest of each partner thus results in conflict of interest which, if not resolved, may result in the failure of the initiative. To address this problem, it is necessary to use an approach based on cooperative game theory which involves pooling the benefits, and then subsequently developing a rational and defensible scheme for sharing the incremental profits among the partners. In this work, we propose the application of a linear programming (LP) cooperative game model to allocate benefits that accrue from interplant integration in an EIP. The approach is first demonstrated using a literature case study, and the results are compared with those determined via alternative cooperative game techniques. Two industrial case studies on interplant integration in palm-based biomass processing complex and sago-based biorefinery (SBB) are then solved to further illustrate the applicability of this technique to problems of more realistic scale.},

	abstract = {Abstract In recent years, the concept of industrial symbiosis (IS) has led to improvements in resource efficiency that may not be possible with individual industrial plants acting independently. One specific aspect is to achieve economies of scale by having multiple companies located in close proximity in order to share common utilities, such as chilled and cooling water. Together, these industrial plants may form an inter-plant chilled and cooling water network (IPCCWN) to achieve greater overall cost savings. Some issues faced by an IPCCWN include network reliability problems due to the consistency of sources' availability, and cost savings allocations for IPCCWN synthesis due to the subjectivity of human preference on decision making. Thus, there exists a need for a decision-making tool to determine a feasible solution that will satisfy all industrial plants in the IPCCWN. In this work, a multi-objective linear programming model is developed to synthesize IPCCWN that achieves maximum cost savings. Next, a Pareto optimal solution is selected using fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) approach. This solution gives the best balance of performance for a set of pre-defined qualitative and quantitative criteria, which is able to account for subjectivity that cannot be addressed from a purely mathematical programming standpoint.},

However, symbiosis will also increase the interdependence of plants, such that when one plant fails, there will be a cascading effect in the entire network. In this work, a criticality index is proposed to quantify the effects of a plant's failure to run at full capacity. This index is the ratio of the fractional change in the net output to the fractional change in capacity of the plant causing the failure. The plants in the entire bioenergy park can then be ranked based on this index. Such information can then be used for developing risk mitigation measures, such us planning for system redundancy. A case study is presented to demonstrate how the method determines the criticality of plants within a bioenergy park.},

In the global move towards a low-carbon society, industrial port cities are emblematic of complex and integrated socio-ecological systems, which are experiencing transition processes related to interactions between bio-geo-physical components and governance. Using a socio-ecological system framework, this article provides insights into innovative regional eco-industrial development strategies for moving toward a low-carbon future in industrial port areas. Based on three case studies (Marseille-Fos in France, Ningbo in China, and Ulsan in South Korea), our analysis focuses on the changing relationships between energy, land cover, time use, and governance. The historical socio-ecological transition of industrial port cities is described as a stepwise process of spatial and functional disconnection/connection of port industrial complexes, which decouple/combine the port city's metabolism from local resources. We highlight the impacts of globalization on port-city socio-ecological trends, describing the effects of the integration of port cities into global economic processes, the impact of global awareness on global environmental changes, and the accelerating pace of change. We compare low-carbon strategies, revealing similarities in terms of conversion toward low carbon sources and growing connectedness and functional diversity of port-industrial systems.},

District Heating System (DHS) using waste heat is highlighted as an attractive solution. However, because of low heat demand in urban areas and the geographic separation of industries, popularizing this solution is considerably difficult in Japan. Previous studies have focused on technical improvements on existing district heating networks, but these studies lack sufficient discussion on an early-stage integrated land-use planning. Supported by technological assessment and emerging concepts of Industrial-Urban Symbiosis (I-US), this study combines the system development of \{DHS\} and land use scenarios into a symbiotic design based on inventory survey and geographic database, and conducts a cost-benefit analysis to scientifically and quantitatively evaluate the effects brought from land-use policies. Results from a case study of Shinchi Town in the Fukushima Prefecture indicate \{DHS\} using waste heat can realize significant benefits of energy saving and \{CO2\} reduction, provided positive guidance on land use planning is implemented. Moreover, the model framework of this study also supports a quantitative assessment on policy implementation to help in decision making on urban sustainable energy planning.},

We review the green real-estate development movement occurring globally, and synthesize applicable concepts into a framework called the expanded business operations model (EBOM) to help companies gauge their goal of environmental stewardship. In contrast to the typical flow diagram of a typical business operations model, the EBOM indicates cycling behavior that synergistically enhances each of the four identified categories—Environment, Facilities, Business Synergism, and Green Image. The ultimate goal of these Eco-smart Corporate Communities is to positively impact the local and larger community, while increasing the economic success of property developers and their tenants. We review governmental policies that drive developers toward environmentally friendly techniques, outline tools and programs that assist in the implementation and evaluation of green design plans, and summarize other drivers (i.e., environmental and social issues) that encourage green building and synthesize them into an indicator system for practitioners' reference. Using four independently operated eco-smart corporate communities as case studies, we identify the measures taken to enhance each of the four categories within the framework, and analyze the cascade of impacts. With this framework, it will be possible to set achievable goals that mark reasonable progress in corporate environmental policies.},

	abstract = {Abstract The scale of industry clusters and their significant environmental impact make addressing environmental strategies on the cluster level an intriguing task. Although several studies indicate that upstream processes contribute significantly to the total environmental impact of the system, few studies assess how environmental strategy development can be approached from a life cycle perspective. The aim of this paper was to investigate the practical significance of life cycle-based environmental strategy development using a chemical industry cluster in Sweden as the case study. To assess the environmental impact, a cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment (LCA) was chosen as the method, with the total annual production of the cluster in 2011 as the functional unit. To cover the whole value chain, the global warming potential for downstream processes was also estimated. The findings were linked to the cluster vision, which aims to reduce environmental impact by 2030. The results indicate that the cluster must focus on the whole value chain when pursuing the aim of producing sustainable products as environmental impact both upstream and downstream of the cluster accounts for a larger share than on-site processes. The assessment also enables distribution of environmental impact among incoming material streams, thus providing the cluster with decision support when introducing renewable and recycled materials. Additionally, the assessment supports strategy comparison and serves as a base case against which strategy opportunities can be evaluated. This study demonstrates that the life cycle approach has interesting potential to support industry cluster companies in their mutual effort to improve environmental performance.},

	abstract = {Many industrial ecologists have focused upon industrial ecosystems and eco-industrial parks as a key strategy for implementing industrial ecology. Some researchers have emphasized developing networks of by-product exchange among co-located companies. This is one among many options for the greening of industrial park design. This article reviews a range of methods for supporting the creation of exchange networks in new eco-industrial parks. Development teams working with established parks or industrial regions can adapt many of these approaches to these other settings. In either case, a central recommendation is to respect the self-organizing nature of the process and to focus on setting conditions that enhance that process.},

	abstract = {Chemical process simulation (CPS) software has been widely used by chemical (process) engineers to design, test, optimise, and integrate process plants. It is expected that industrial ecologists to bring these same problem-solving benefits to the design and operation of industrial ecosystems can use CPS. This paper provides industrial ecology researchers and practitioners with an introduction to CPS and an overview of chemical engineering design principles. The paper highlights recent research showing that CPS can be used to model industrial ecosystems, and discusses the benefits of using CPS to address some of the technical challenges facing companies participating in an industrial ecosystem. CPS can be used to (i) quantitatively evaluate and compare the potential environmental and financial benefits of material and energy linkages; (ii) solve general design, retrofit, or operational problems; (iii) help to identify complex and often counter-intuitive solutions; and (iv) evaluate what-if scenarios. CPS should be a useful addition to the industrial ecology toolbox.},

	abstract = {The concept ‘waste' was assessed, and redefined as ‘an emerged quality of a substance'. A substance or object is qualified a waste when it is not used to its full potential'. Under this paradigm, any process can be used for the transformation of waste to remove this quality label, and the necessity of a systemic approach to the resource and waste management becomes obvious. Any substance, labelled waste or resource, is part of at least one material cycle. Material cycle modelling provides a convenient method of abstraction to present the system alternatives to decision-makers and emphasises the interdependence between the availability and fate of all atomic elements in primary production and waste management. The rearrangement and closing of material cycles, for example, opens the way to eliminate landfills of harmful residues and contributes to the conservation of resources. While the adoption of the new paradigm may lead to dramatic technological development, the consideration, appreciation and adoption of such integrated resource and waste systems by decision-makers must be adequately supported by the apt supply of accessible information on system structure, technology options and effects. To determine the scope of the decision support tool, four images of 2030's waste infrastructure were constructed. Public awareness and attitude were identified as the main parameters that determine the future context, apart from technological development, resource scarcity and final abatement of waste processing residues.},

	abstract = {As the process of global environmental reform and strategic adjustment, the greening of industry is the changing process of the firms' environmental awareness and reactions to the growing environmental pressures coming from governments, the public and markets, in order to let firms reduce pollution to meet the need of sustainable development and improvement of the living environmental quality, hereby is the inevitable way to achieve economic and environmental harmonious development and regional sustainable development. The greening of the industry has first been practiced in the western developed countries since the 1960s where the responses of the firms to environmental pressures has changed from non cooperation in the 1960s to active participation in the 1990s. Firms have shifted their reluctant behaviors to the willingness to take their responsibility and to active participation in order to strengthen their competitive abilities. However, the greening of industry in our country has made few progress compared to the developed countries. Whereas geographers have seldom been engaged in this field, and less attention has been paid to the external pressures such as markets, communities, investors and consumers as well as the relationship between environmental pressures and firms behavior. Because of the rapid economic development and environmental deterioration, it is imperative to speed up the research of the greening of industry which would be the new field widening the research of the industrial environmental geography. The foci of the study can be identified as the following aspects: the stage evaluation of the greening of industry, analyses of the type and the change of the environmental pressures as well as the firms environmental awareness and reactions, the impact of the environmental pressures on the firms responses, ecological and economic availability evaluation, and then seeking efficient way to get both economic and environmental achievements.},

The results are based on a case study of a Swedish municipality with a developed forest industry. The actors' views are discussed together with the most important factors to enable increased integration and for exchange to take place. The greatest barriers found were the lack of knowledge and resources, attitudes, time frames, development consent, and lack of continuity and local power for some companies. One conclusion is that the municipal authority could have a role as coordinator of local integration projects. However, this role can be impeded by the weak integration of different divisions in the municipality's organisation and it is suggested that companies with integration as their business concept can be key actors when developing more integrated networks. It was also clear that intraorganisational issues may impede interorganisational integration.},

	abstract = {Eco-efficiency has been receiving increasing attention across the world. This paper proposes an extended data envelopment analysis model, which combines global benchmark technology, directional distance function and a bootstrapping approach to investigate the dynamic trends of regional eco-efficiency in China from 2003 to 2014. Moreover, a developed slacks-based measure is utilized to decompose the performance fluctuations into resource, environmental and economic efficiency. Then, the key factors responsible for the changes in eco-efficiency are explored using the global Malmquist–Luenberger index. The empirical results demonstrate an upward trend of eco-efficiency in China. During the study period this trend was high in eastern and northern areas but low in northwestern areas. However, it should be noted that some eco-efficient regions still consume much land, water and energy and emit much environmental pollutants in absolute terms. The whole of China performs well on the economic front, while resource and environmental performances are not encouraging, particularly on environmental efficiency. The eastern and northern regions have experienced the greatest advances in both resource and environmental efficiency, while the undeveloped areas have not shown much progress, which further widens the gaps between developed areas and undeveloped areas. The decomposition of productivity growth indicates that technical progress is the decisive factor in promoting China's eco-efficiency, while decreasing management level is the major obstacle hampering the improvement in eco-efficiency.},

Furthermore, the evolution and convergence characteristics of regional technical efficiency are examined by a dynamic regression model based on different regional divisions of China. The empirical results show that there exist significant geographical differences in the technical efficiency of Chinese iron and steel industry. On the one hand, the technical efficiency of the eastern area, the central area and the western area is unbalanced, with a lower efficiency in the west and a higher one in the east. On the other hand, technical efficiency of Central Bohai, Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta economic zones is higher than that of the other economic zones. In addition, the technical efficiency has a significant improvement during the period of the Eleventh Five-Year Plan. Following the convergence notation in economic growth theory, this paper also gives some convergence evidence of the technical efficiency towards the efficient frontier due to the catching-up effect. Finally, this paper explores the determinants of the technical efficiency, and discusses policy implications for Chinese iron and steel industry.},

The ecological theories have played a guiding role. However, there are not enough academic researches to systematically summarize and analyze the relation and connection between ecology and resource recycling. Therefore, we based on the ecological theories to analyze the theoretical basis and application for resources recycling. The results showed that the ecological threshold theory, ecological balance theory, Overall hierarchy theory, the food chain (web) theory, niche theory and so on can be used to explain the resource circulation system such as resources recycling building concepts, resources recycling industry development foundation and the government's role in promoting resources circulation process. Based on the application of ecological theory for constructing the resource circulation system, further analysis of the scientific laws for the government regulation may help understand the concept of resource circulation and essence of circular economic system operation.},

This article provides a new approach to capture synergies within industrial parks by suggesting a new business model. Building on findings from a survey conducted by the authors and on literature, we first identify potential barriers to low-carbon synergistic projects. Economic concerns of technically feasible synergies and financial issues turn out to be the largest barriers, because of long payback periods and fluctuating raw material and by-product market prices. Existing business models do not offer easy ways to overcome or relax these barriers. We therefore introduce the concept of a synergy management services company (SMSCO), a synergy contractor and third-party financing model, to overcome these barriers. This model shifts the financial risk of the synergistic project from collaborating firms to the SMSCO. We posit that this attribute of the SMSCO model makes it attractive for industrial park operators who seek long-term solutions to secure future viability of their park.},

In this article, we propose a fresh look at this research topic, building on the considerable advances that have been made in the last 15 years in understanding how IS comes about. We propose a conceptual and theoretical framework for taking on the challenge of comparative analysis at a global level. This requires developing an approach to address a solution to the problem of equivalence: the difficulty of comparing instances of IS across different institutional contexts. The proposed framework emphasizes IS as a process and attempts to address the obstacles to comparative study by (1) identifying terminology to examine IS variants, (2) providing a typology of IS dynamics, and (3) formulating key research questions to illuminate a way forward. In developing our argument, we build on the collective experiences of collaborative research efforts in North America, Europe, and Asia as evidenced in recent overviews of the literature.},

	abstract = {Within the emerging concept of industrial ecology (IE) that belongs to the research and practical field of sustainable development (SD), the natural ecosystem evolution over time has been described as a metaphor that presents systems of type I, type II and type III ecology. Type I describes a situation when there was little life on earth and plenty of resources. In type II, the ecosystem starts to develop material cycles and energy cascades between organisms and species due to increasing amount of life and emerging scarcity of resources. In type III, the mature ecosystem stage, the system actors have developed nearly completely cyclic flows of matter, energy cascades and diverse interdependencies between them. This paper uses the metaphor in the three systems to develop practical models of type I, II and III industrial ecosystems for an economic system of heating energy and its evolution over time. First, the physical flows of matter and energy are described by using two contrasting case system characteristics, `throughput' and `roundput'. Throughput means linear material and energy flows. Roundput means material cycles, energy cascades and sustainable use of renewables, i.e., ecosystem type III. Second, the more structural and organisational features are considered with the characteristic of `diversity' meaning diversity in resources, human involvement and economic actors and technology used. The case system development over time shown with our practical model of type I-III is radically different from the ecosystem evolution as described in the literature on the industrial ecosystem metaphor of type I-III. This conclusion as a research result, however, is tentative, because of the fuzzy and vague meaning assigned to a metaphor and its confusion with a practical model of industrial development in the industrial ecology literature.},

	abstract = {Forestry, forest, pulp and paper industries provide important cases for environmental and ecological economics and for corporate environmental management, because of the large quantities of flows of material and energy that are derived from the natural ecosystem. Because of the natural capital intensive nature of its activity, the forest industry also offers a fruitful case study for industrial ecology (IE), the practical concern of which is the comparison of material and energy flows of nature to these same flows in economic and industrial systems. In this paper, the concept of an industrial ecosystem is reflected in a typical local forest industry system in Finland, known as `a local forest industry integrate'. We present a material and energy flow model that can be used to study forest industry environmental management and for the planning of environmental policies directed to forest industry. Flows of matter (biomass), nutrients, energy and carbon are described, and the waste utilization possibilities are considered. A local forest industry system can be a fruitful case for IE development as the cuttings of forests in Finland are below the renewal rate, material cycles, nutrient cycles and energy cascades are developed and the carbon dioxide (CO2) binding capacity of the forest ecosystem is maintained. The difficulties and barriers in light of the industrial ecosystem vision of a materially closed local system include the high export rates of paper, energy intensive production and problem displacement in waste utilization efforts. The presented material and energy flow model of forest industry environmental management is compared with a case of a local agricultural and food industry system. For agro-food sector applications, a different emphasis on the flows may have to be adopted than in a forest industry application. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.},

	abstract = {Industrial Ecology is an industrial environmental management concept with an analogy in the natural ecosystem, In an ecosystem, materials are recycled between organisms, and energy is embedded in the matter of the food chain, while the only external input to the system as a whole is the solar energy. An Industrial Ecosystem is a system where the industrial actors use this natural recycling model and co-operate by using each other's waste material and waste energy flows to minimize the system virgin material and energy input as well as the waste and emission output from the system as a whole. In theory, the economic environment win-win can be achieved as raw material, emission control and waste management costs are reduced through using waste as a resource of production. In this paper, the material and energy flows of the forest ecosystem are considered, and this natural recycling model is used to construct an industrial ecosystem in the forest industry of Finland. Recycling of matter including nutrients and carbon constitutes the basis in the operation of the forest ecosystem as well as in the operation of the forest industry system. The forest industry will use the cycle in these flows as a source of raw materials and energy. An industrial ecosystem is constructed with the flows of matter, nutrients, energy and carbon.

Its central holistic concept is the Total Human Ecosystem as the highest level of co-evolutionary complexity in the global ecological hierarchy, with solar energy powered biosphere and fossil energy powered technosphere landscapes as its concrete systems. Landscape ecology could contribute to their structural and functional integration into a coherent sustainable ecosphere and thereby to the establishment of a sustainable balance between attractive and productive biosphere landscapes and healthy and livable technosphere landscapes for this and future generation. By utilizing new insights in self-organization of autopioetic systems and their cross-catalytic networks in the Total Human Ecosystem for synergistic benefits of the people, their economy and landscapes, such holistic landscape ecology together with other mission-driven transdisciplinary environmental sciences could serve as a catalyst for the urgently needed post-industrial symbiosis between nature and human society.

	abstract = {Traditional system dynamics studies rely heavily upon heuristics and experience. Nevertheless, mathematical exploration techniques have been introduced as important elements for a successful study. We argue that the role of optimization in system dynamics studies is not to replace experience-based knowledge, but instead to augment, facilitate, and expand the heuristic exploration of a model. Accordingly, our approach involves narrowing the design space (using response surfaces) and the subsequent direct investigation of the simulation model (using heuristics), Response surfaces have received considerable attention in optimization because of their capability to replace complex models with analytic equations, thereby increasing computational efficiency. However, doubts exist as to the usefulness of a response-surface approximation of an approximation of reality (i.e., a system dynamics model). We demonstrate the usefulness of response surfaces in system dynamics studies with a case study involving a high-level model of an industrial ecosystem; our intent in using response surfaces is not to replace the simulation models with analytic equations, but instead to direct attention to regions within the design space of the original simulation with the most desirable performance. Recommended changes to a system are based directly on the simulation model, not on response surfaces, avoiding the added level of approximation inherent in response surfaces. The primary focus of the article is on the concept exploration approach, which is presented first. The case study towards the end is offered as supporting evidence.

This is a perceptual error consistent with the technological optimism inherent in the prevailing expansionist cultural worldview. By contrast, ecological analysis reveals that modem cities are actually increasingly dependent on the goods and services of nature. This fact is merely obscured by technology and urbanization itself. Typical high-income cities appropriate the productive and assimilative capacity of a vast and increasingly global hinterland, resulting in an “ecological footprint' several hundred times larger than the areas they physically occupy. In the next 27 years, the urban population alone is expected to grow by the equivalent of the total human population in the 1930s. This will double the 1970s urban presence on the Earth. Unfortunately, the conventional development path is biophysically unsustainable, calling for a radical transformation of our thinking about urban form and function. Buildings account for 40\% of the materials and about a third of the energy consumed by the world economy. Combined with ecocity design principles, green building technologies therefore have the potential to make an enormous contribution to a required 50\% reduction in thr? energy and material intensity of consumption globally: The needed dematerialization increases-to 90\% in the high-income countries. Such enormous gains m material productivity are unlikely in the absence of significant ecological fiscal (tax) reform. Ironically, then, the most effective path to green buildings and ecocities may be intensive lobbying for higher taxes on primary energy and materials.},

In this cultural evolutionary process, the restoration of natural and cultural landscapes should play a vital role. For this purpose, it has to be guided by a holistic and transdisciplinary systems approach, aiming not only at the organismic but also at the functional and structural restoration of ecological and cultural diversity as total landscape ecodiversity. For the development of suitable restoration strategies, a clear distinction has to be made between different functional classes of natural and cultural solar-powered biosphere and fossil-powered technosphere landscapes, according to their inputs and throughputs of energy and materials, their organisms, their control by natural or human information, their internal self-organization and their regenerative capacities. Not only technosphere landscapes but also intensive agroindustrial landscapes have lost these capacities and are heavily subsidized by fossil energy and chemicals, to the detriment of the environment and human health. They therefore have to be rehabilitated by more sustainable but not less productive agricultural systems based on organic farming. But their natural regenerative capacities can be restored only by regenerative systems, with the help of cultural “neotechnic” information. The promise for an urgently required evolutionary symbiosis between human society and nature in a sustainable post-industrial total human ecosystem lies in the functional integration of such innovative regenerative systems and all natural and cultural biosphere landscapes with healthier and more livable technosphere landscapes. To this goal, ecological and cultural landscape restoration can make an important contribution.},

The presumed objective of industrial ecosystem design and innovation is to efficiently and economically deploy natural and industrial resources with minimal risks to the integrity of significant natural processes of the biosphere. Mathematical tools for such an expansion derive from the premise that, for given intervals of time, industrial and natural ecosystems and their interactions can be characterized by hierarchies of bounded networks of biotic and abiotic resource acquisition, conversion, and transfer processes. The hierarchies illustrated in this paper range from modular networks of production technologies in manufacturing and refining to food chains and sequential products to biological communities and industrial production networks to product life cycles and beyond. The ecology of each resource conversion process within a bounded network of processes is characterized mathematically in terms of the principles of material and energy balance, with energy as one of many biotic and abiotic enabling factors of resource acquisition, conversion, and transfer that are ecologically quantified and monetarily priced. Design equations are developed that map the ecologies of bounded networks of ecological processes into the ecology of the network at its boundary, thereby providing operational procedures for mathematically defining hierarchial network structures. At the lowest level of ecological organization, all constituent network processes are observable first-order natural processes or engineered technologies. The economics of a given industrial enterprise are evaluated as an explicit mathematical function of its network of production technologies, its ecological organization, and its ecological boundary prices; thereby providing procedures for the coordinated design, management, and accounting of its technological, ecological. and economic dimensions at hierarchial levels of organization from factory floors and farms to corporate levels and beyond.

This paper examines the structural framework of biological ecology and the tools used for its study, and it demonstrates that many aspects of biological organisms and ecosystems (for example, food webs, engineering activities, community development) do have parallels in industrial organisms and ecosystems. Some of the tools of biological ecology appear to be applicable to industrial ecology, and vice versa. In a world in which no biological ecosystem is free of human influence and no industrial ecosystem is free of biological influence, it is appropriate to abandon the artificial division between the two frameworks and develop a new synthesis-Earth system ecology-as the logical construct for all of Earth's ecosystems.},

This issue is treated from the viewpoint of the validity of the so-called urban symbiosis hypothesis and its complementary selective centrifugality hypothesis. For this purpose three latent variables are formulated. These are based on the concepts `selection environment', `innovation potential' and `innovativeness'; and then interrelationships are estimated in terms of multiple indicators by the Partial Least Squares method(PLS). Analysing the relations between these three concepts, the main finding is that a great many (urban) regions in the central parts of the Netherlands (the so-called Rimcity or Randstad) appear to be in a rather unfavourable position regarding innovative capacity of small industrial firms, even for firms which on an average are assumed to have favourable technological prospects. The results cast some doubt on the validity of the urban symbiosis hypothesis, whereas the selective centrifugality hypothesis appears to be more valid in the Dutch context.},

This study aims at comparing the environmental profile of eco-innovation options for a cosmetic product by means of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. We present a case study in which synthetic ingredients are replaced by others derived from natural compounds, following green chemistry principles. A C16-18 triglycerides mixture (INCI name “palmitic/stearic triglycerides”) derived from olive oil industry by-products is used both as single ingredient (Innovation I) and as part of a preformulated one (Innovation II), replacing the starting formulation (Benchmark) caprylic/capric triglyceride. Options are compared through LCA applying International Life Cycle Data impact assessment focusing the analysis to water and energy consumption, sources of raw materials and previous manufacturing stages thereof. In order to test the robustness of the results, we performed a set of sensitivity analyses: i) changing assumptions about transports and irrigation of olive trees; ii) comparing results of the application of two life cycle impact assessment methods (CML and IMPACT 2002). The results show that the impacts derived from the selection of ingredients are more significant than those due to water and energy consumption. Applying different methods, results show significant differences, especially in toxicity-related impact categories. Overall, an alleged “eco-friendly” ingredient (such as a natural by-product derived one) could result in a less preferable environmental profile if assessed in a life cycle perspective. This supports the need of adopting life cycle based methods to ensure that green chemistry options respond to the need of reducing environmental in all life cycle stages. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to understand how firms engage in new processes, strategies and behaviors for sustainable innovation. It results on a non-linear, recursive and self-organized process that can be studied as a complex adaptive system. Based on an integrative literature review, we find five ontological sustainable innovation components: operational, collaborative, organizational, instrumental, and holistic. Our analysis also yields three complex adaptive system phenorhena, which explain three main patterns of how components interact and interconnect: non-linearity, self-organization and emergence. The three phenomena are mutually dependent and specific to each company. Non-linearity explains the connection between the components, including positive and negative feedback loops and the rates of change, disorder, chaos and stability between them. Self-organization increases the order or regularity between the components interaction and even generates a new order and configuration with the different components behaving autonomously. Emergence involves radically new processes and component interactions due to new and radical experimentation, rule-breaking and disruptive sustainable technologies. Each phenomenon is explained in three extended examples, including three interaction mechanisms describing the dynamics of the five components. The outcomes of this research provide a new approach to theory-building in the sustainable innovation field and serve as the basis for further research on the complexity of engaging sustainable innovation in firms. This suggests new research questions regarding the role of firms in sustainable innovation and sustainable system transitions. It also calls for more interdisciplinary work on the issue due to the systemic nature of sustainable innovation at the firm level. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A global multiregional input output (MRIO) model was built for eight Chinese cities to track their carbon flows. For in-depth understanding of urban carbon footprint from the perspectives of production, consumption, and trade balance, four kinds of footprints and four redefined measurement indicators were calculated. From the global supply chain, urban carbon inflows from Mainland China were larger than outflows, while the carbon outflows to European, principal North American countries and East Asia were much larger than inflows. With the rapid urbanization of China, Construction was the largest consumer and Utilities was the largest producer. Cities with higher consumption (such as Dalian, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Beijing) should change their consumption patterns, while cities with lower production efficiency (such as Dalian, Shanghai, Ningbo, and Chongqing) should improve their technology. The cities of net carbon consumption tended to transfer carbon emissions out of them by trading in carbon-intensive products, while the cities of net carbon production tended to produce carbon-intensive products for nonlocal consumers. Our results indicated that urban carbon abatement requires not only rational consumption and industrial symbiosis at the city level, but also tighter collaboration along all stages of the global supply chain.},

	abstract = {The analysis presents an evolving `Energy Concept' and strategy at an energy-intensive research facility in order to contribute understanding of how organisations may implement renewable energies and improve energy efficiency whilst also delivering broader socio-economic benefits. A framework is developed that infuses institutional perspectives with a micro level view. It facilitates positioning of strategy against instrumental/altruistic and factual/relational extremes and analysis of organisational strategy in the face of internal/external stakeholder, and institutional forces. Applied to a seven-year case this supports understanding of strategy `purpose' and `inputs' as they co-evolve along a project time-line. It is found that the energy strategy evolves from a dominantly instrumental but stakeholder-driven position towards approaches aligned with deliberate public good provision in areas beyond direct organizational interests, and that changes required significant redefinition of the design and operational models. Developments are explained as largely the result of internal agency and culture-building influences from an energy department equipped with concrete management tools and autonomy. At the case level, the study concludes that the Energy Concept implementation has sparked a change in energy management at large global research facilities. The work also demonstrates that longitudinal, multi-level institutional analysis can contribute to deeper understanding of strategy development. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Here the municipality energy advisors and the national register for energy performance certificates can facilitate the mitigation of energy use in the building stock. So far few studies have focused on the practical road map to the national target of energy use on the city/district level and to the communication aspects with stakeholders in the creation of energy city models. In this paper a city energy model is developed based on the requests and need for visualization from a group of energy advisors. Six different scenarios are studied in order to analyze the possibility of reaching the energy targets specified by the government in the town of Kiruna. The results show that: (1) it is possible to automatically create city energy models using extract, transform and load tools based on spatial and non-spatial data from national registers and databases; (2) city energy models improve the understanding of energy use in buildings and can therefore be a valuable tool for energy advisors, real estate companies and urban planners. The case study of Kiruna showed that the proposed energy saving measures in the energy performance certificates need to be implemented and new buildings in the urban transformation must be of high energy standard in order to reach the national target in Kiruna.

This article was written in conjunction with reports by the United Nations Environment Program's International Resource Panel that quantifies and compares the environmental and natural resource impacts and benefits of using demand-side efficient technologies for greenhouse gas mitigation scenarios from now until 2050. In this article, we examine the potential of using distributed energy sources in future energy systems. First, we reviewed the existing research into several energy technologies, especially into cogeneration systems for CHP, using a bibliometric analysis. The current energy supply/demand in the demand-side sectors in Japan is also reviewed using available statistical data, and an investigation into the energy requirements of industrial manufacturers was performed. After systematizing the results of our review on progress in current research, a scenario analysis was conducted on the potential of distributed energy sources to clarify the contribution of the various technology options. A mismatch between the quality of energy produced, especially heat, or any benefits arising from scale from other energy technologies, can decrease the incentive to implement distributed energy technologies. As a requirement of a regional energy system design and management, distributed energy sources should be considered so that the appropriate technology options can be adopted for the desired energy supply in the demand-side sector. The possibility exists to replace conventional single-generation technologies, such as boilers or power generators, with multigeneration technologies. A change in the grid power mix is one of the most sensitive parameters affecting the performance of cogeneration technologies.},

	abstract = {The growth in socioeconomic metabolism associated with industrialization is altering the functions of the biosphere, becoming the major drivers of global climate change. An environmental friendly or low-carbon-oriented industrial transition not only would largely improve the patterns and magnitude of physical exchanges among societies and their natural environment, but would also be inextricably linked with regional sustainable development policies which can be effective to achieve post-fossil carbon societies. Above all, several institutional innovations and rules, such as industrial symbiosis and low carbon pathway optimization should be considered in scenario analysis and path selection. In this study, a long term analysis focusing on the industrial system in China is presented. Carbon emission decomposition analysis is used to evaluate the potential of low carbon development, promote policies regarding regional sustainable development and construction of eco-industry. Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) decomposition is applied to carbon emissions in the decomposition of time and space sequence. An analysis of the state of the art of climate change science and of the state of industrial symbiosis attempting to create effective industrial development paths reveals that the LMDI Decomposition method can provide crucial orientation for the negotiations towards a sustainable post fossil carbon societies. Three scenarios are designed for the analysis: the Business as Usual (BaU) scenario, the Carbon Reduction (CR) scenario and the Integrated Low Carbon Economy (ILCE) scenario. Under the assumptions that the share of coal will decline dramatically under the CR and ILCE scenarios from 2009 to 2050 while the share of natural gas and renewable energy will be greatly increased, through the adjustment of energy structure, improvement of energy efficiency and transformation of technical energy merit, energy consumption demand and carbon emission trend in industrial sectors till 2050 in China is simulated, in order to provide the basis for low-carbon industrial transformation in China.

Even today, fossil fuel such as natural gas is the main raw material and the main source of primary energy in nitrogen fertilizer production. According to the data of the Ministry of Energy of the Republic of Lithuania, about 40 \% of total natural gas consumption in Lithuania is used in the fertilizer production company. Evaluation of the possibilities to reduce energy intensity and use alternative resources in nitrogen fertilizer production is the main objective of this research. All the technological processes of nitrogen fertilizer production in the analyzed company are objects of research of this work. Recent researches into the area of cleaner chemical product production are reviewed and systematized. The methods of cleaner production (CP), industrial ecology, material flow analysis, environmental impact assessment, and evaluation of environmental efficiency are integrated into the methodology of this work. Results of the initial environmental analysis of nitrogen fertilizer production processes show that the analyzed company has already implemented several CP projects with a view to minimizing energy intensity and air emissions. Despite their efforts, an enormous amount of energy is wasted in the main and additional processes (for example, ammonia production, cooling process, and heat energy production). Several alternatives for resource efficiency and energy saving have been suggested when doing the research. This paper presents the results of the feasibility analysis of three case studies in which pollution prevention methods are applied jointly with industrial symbiosis.},

The authors identify two main challenges within the field of sustainable investments that are relevant for entering new avenues that may help overcome this situation. First, a reorientation toward a long-term paradigm for sustainable investments is important. Second, ESG data must become more trustworthy.

The top-down approach described from 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines was used to estimate CO2 emissions from national fuel combustion and electricity generation. Results affirm the negative impacts of economic growth and higher standard of living to CO2 emissions, and reveal the significant damages inconsistent energy structures deliver to the emissions performance of a country. This has never been highlighted in previous studies in ASEAN and other developing countries.

Additionally, local shortages of very cheap digestible feedstocks limit biogas productivity, especially for larger biogas power plants ({\textgreater}1 MWe). Innovations that could improve cost-effectiveness and resource efficiency of biogas energy technology are therefore required. Over the last few years a number of potential process innovations for biogas technology have been proposed and investigated. However, the majority of these novel concepts has minimal or no impact on technology development. Disruptive innovations are very rare, but only they really matter for the economy. Therefore review reports that sytematically compare, analyze and evaluate the suitability of these emerging methods with emphasis on technological excellence and realistic commercial potential are needed. This study presents potential process innovations from most recent patent and academic literature proposed for biogas (i) production, (ii) conditioning, (iii) utilizatiori and (iv) industrial symbiosis. Within these four highly interdisciplinary categories the review attempts to provide short practical comments on selected methods and briefly analyzes their perspectives and constraints. Further, relevant biogas process innovation criteria are designed and multiple-criteria assessment of pre-selected potential process innovations is made. The paper concludes with the characterization of innovativeness of selected solutions and suggests future research needs for biogas energy technology that could bring new innovations in near term.

	abstract = {Improvement in nutrient recycling in agriculture is essential to maintain food production while minimising nutrient pollution of the environment. For this purpose, understanding and modelling nutrient cycles in food and related agro-industrial systems is a crucial task. Although nutrient management has been addressed at the plot and farm scales for many years now in the agricultural sciences, there is a need to upscale these approaches to capture the additional drivers of nutrient cycles that may occur at the local, i.e. district, scale. Industrial ecology principles provide sound bases to analyse nutrient cycling in complex systems. However, since agro-food social-ecological systems have specific ecological and social dimensions, we argue that a new field, referred to as “Agro-Industrial Ecology”, is needed to study these systems. In this paper, we review the literature on nutrient cycling in complex social-ecological systems that can provide a basis for Agro-Industrial Ecology. We identify and describe three major approaches: Environmental Assessment tools, Stock and Flow Analysis methods and Agent-based models. We then discuss their advantages and drawbacks for assessing and modelling nutrient cycles in agro-food systems in terms of their purpose and scope, object representation and time-spatial dynamics. We finally argue that combining stock-flow methods with both agent-based models and environmental impact assessment tools is a promising way to analyse the role of economic agents on nutrient flows and losses and to explore scenarios that better close the nutrient cycles at the local scale.

	abstract = {There are various technologies that have been developed to reduce nitrogen oxide (NO.) gas emissions from nitric acid plants. The current study, however, focused on chemical absorption with the following key objectives. First, the paper assessed several reaction pathways that entail the use of combination of common industrial absorbents and oxidants for the absorption of NO.. Second, an analysis on the production of potassium nitrate (KNO3) fertilizer using the byproducts formed from chemical absorption was studied. In addition, a life cycle assessment (LCA) on the environmental implications of NOx absorption and byproducts utilisation for the production of fertiliser through industrial symbiosis was evaluated. This was performed to find the combination of absorbent and oxidant with the least environmental impacts for industrial symbiotic formation. The goal of the LCA was set as the production of 1 kg of potassium nitrate fertiliser. The analysis has shown that use of hydrogen peroxide in combination with calcium hydroxide had the least environmental impacts per kg KNO3 produced. These were a global warming potential (GWP) of 9 kg CO2 equivalent emissions (CO2-e), acidification potential (AP) of -0.073 kg sulphur dioxide equivalent (kg SO2-e), eutrophication potential (EP) of -0.058 kg phosphate equivalent (kg PO4–e), 0.1 kg of solid waste generated, and 15.7 L of water used. The most striking finding was that this combination reduced the overall GWP, AP and EP per kg KNO3 produced by 7.8 kg of CO2-e, 0.12 kg SO2-e and 0.08 kg PO4–e respectively in comparison to the production of conventional KNO3 fertilizer. The hot-spots for all reaction pathways were water and energy use. Water use could not be reduced due to effects on reaction efficiencies for all pathways. However, a solution to reduce the carbon footprint from energy use is the substitution of energy generated from fossils with wind energy. This was evaluated to have the potential of reducing GHG emissions of ozone use by up to 93\%, leading to overall GWP reduction of about 86\% and 80\% for calcium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide use with ozone respectively.

This was followed by comprehensive research that resulted in several high quality scientific contributions published in the Journal of Cleaner Production. The wide topical coverage and the high quality provided excellent directions for future collaborative research of the PRES family - including process level emission minimisation, self-sufficient regions, and industrial symbiosis for optimizing usage of waste heat and waste material flows.

The establishment of an ecoindustrial park (EIP) that originates from the concept of industrial symbiosis allows individual plants to cooperate with each other so as to achieve greater water and energy recovery through interplant chilled/cooling water reuse/recycle. However, periodical circumstances such as variation of market demands and plant shutdown schedules, which are common in different business operations, have not been well considered in designing an EIP. Thus, there is a need to study explicitly the effect of such periodical operations due to the high level of connectivity within an EIP. This paper presents a design methodology to develop a robust EIP by integrating a set of multiperiod chilled and cooling water networks.

	abstract = {Human health impacts come from genetic factors and from the environment. Human health impacts, as nature versus nurture (genetic versus non-shared chemical environmental), have currently been represented in genomics only as the human genome (double helix). The discovery of the genomic structure for the non-shared chemical environmental (the environment) component fills a conceptual gap and thus provides a more complete understanding of total impact on human health. When mapped, the environmental genome of industrial products (EGIP) would serve as a global framework for assessing broad and clustered health effects (human and ecological) at the local and global levels. Thus products for society have coupled benefits and impacts. The environmental genome is pyramidal rather than helical. The shape of the EGIP is, x = n(y), where n is a structural building unit (SBU) which is different for each of the 100 000 chemicals, x is the complexity of the industrial ecosystem to make the product (width of genome), and y is the levels or stages from natural resources to product (length of genome). The environmental genome is approximately the same informational size (0.5-8 billion pieces) as the human genome (3 billion chemical pairs). The pyramidal environmental genomic pieces span from natural resources (containing much of the Periodic Table) to the final chemical/material products in commerce of which there are about 100 000 which comprise all products. In summary, “the human genome is held in awe as it created each of us. The environmental genome of industrial products must be respected for it is what we as humans have truly created.”},

Based on principal component analysis and grey correlation analysis, a model of the optimizing degree of Chinese economic industrial ecosystem is developed at the provincial level, and a mathematical definition of the optimization degree is provided to evaluate the provincial industrial ecosystem from a relatively new perspective. Based on their optimization degrees, the thirty provinces of China are classified into four categories in terms of their economy-environment-innovation relation: the harmonious region, the gearing region, the rivaling region and the discordant region. By fitting the curve of Environment Kuznets Curve (EKC) with a cubic function for each category, we show that each category has its own shape of EKC: category I has the monotonically decreasing curve, category II has a inverted U shaped curve, category III has a N-shaped curve, while category IV has a U-shaped curve. Our results show how the category's optimization degree of industrial ecosystem affects the relation of economic growth to environmental quality. In particular, for the region I whose optimization degree gamma{\textgreater}0.7, the relation between economic growth and environmental pollutants is harmonious; for the region II whose optimization degree 0.6{\textless}gamma{\textless}0.7, the relation is rivaling; for the region III whose optimization degree 0.5{\textless}gamma{\textless}0.6, the relation is conflicting; and for the region IV whose optimization degree gamma{\textless}0.5, the relation is discordant.},

	abstract = {Current rapid urban development, particularly in Asian cities, is facing various challenges, such as resource depletion, environmental emissions and increasing pressures on responding climate change. It is critical for decision-makers to raise the appropriate urban development strategies so that cities can move toward sustainable development. In this regard, well-designed evaluation methods are valuable for managing environmental development and providing guidelines to improve sustainable urban development. Six well-known assessment methods for environment and sustainability assessment, namely, input-output analysis (IOA), life-cycle analysis (LCA), ecological footprint (EF), carbon footprint (CF), emergy analysis and cost benefit analysis are selected. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages. This paper provides a comprehensive literature review on these methods and proposes an integration of different methods so that the holistic performance of one eco-city initiative can be scientifically evaluated and key problems can be identified. Such an integration can solve the problems that each single method is facing so that valuable policy insights can be identified for urban decision-makers to prepare more appropriate urban strategies.

	abstract = {Eco-town developments have been the testing grounds to improve upon the urban policies and practices in the Northern and Western European countries since the early 1990s. It has been widely discussed as to whether or how they have helped transitioning of towns and cities into more sustainable systems in the larger urban context through educational, experiential, societal diffusion and changes in governance processes. The countries in different cultural and geographical contexts with rapid urbanization rates, seek to establish similar developments with relatively less knowledge of the contextual and procedural differences in the eco-towns' processes or the reasons for their varying levels of impact. This article was prepared to summarize and systematize the insights that have been obtained from `eco-town' based urban developments implemented in the Northwestern Europe with particular emphasis given into the examples from The Netherlands, Sweden and Germany. The review of the relevant literature was conducted with the focus on: a. the context in which the demonstration eco-towns were developed since the emergence of planned communities in the early 20th century, b. the typologies, processes and frameworks through which the eco-towns were initiated, built, governed and evolved. The authors analyzed the wide diversity of frameworks and processes that have played roles in the relative successes and/or failures. The review provided insights into their procedures and the aspects associated with the diffusion of the lessons into the broader urban planning and development methods. The findings suggested that the political commitment, timing, financial aspects, physical qualities, stakeholder involvement and environmental planning were key elements in achieving the eco-towns' goals. Future research is recommended to critically analyze the impacts of these historically new urban development models and frameworks in order to create more effective approaches for achieving positive outcomes for all societies within ecological boundaries.

Portfolio options of technologies for different types of WTE supply chains were illustrated for achieving circular economy system. Since policy makers have to address the public concerns prior to promulgate and implement relating regulations, the strategies on implementation of WTE supply chain were proposed to overcome the challenging barriers from the aspects of technology, finance, institution and regulation. A total of eight key task-forces were also proposed for effectively executing the strategies. Furthermore, several successful lessons on WTE supply chains such as green fuel pellet for heating supply and co-digestion of organic wastes for bio-gas production around the world were reviewed and illustrated.

	abstract = {The aim of mine tailings management strategy is to protect the environment and humans from risks associated with mine tailings. It seems inevitable that future production from lower grade ores in mines will increase, generating a higher tonnage of tailings. Approximately 14 billion tonnes of tailings were produced globally by the mining industry in 2010. The need for a comprehensive framework for mine tailings management (including dewatering) that promotes sustainable development is therefore becoming increasingly recognised by the mining industry. In this paper, we review existing frameworks for tailings management and propose an improved framework that considers key sustainable development pillars: technological, economic, environmental, policy, and social aspects. This framework will be able to guide the mining sector to choose its mine tailings management strategy based on sustainable development concepts. It incorporates a range of tools for determining trade-offs inherent in different tailings management methods during operation and throughout the Life of Mine (LOM); these include Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), Net Present Value (NPV), Hierarchy System Model (HSM), and Decision. Analysis. In particular, this proposed recognises the highly case-specific of tailings management by explicitly integrating physicochemical characterisation of tailings properties as a first step. In future, the framework could be expanded through integration of reuse/recycle principles of industrial symbiosis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Thus, urban-rural fringes and townships featuring natural ecosystems have automatically become recreational hotspots. The Wulai District is located at the fringe of the Taipei metropolitan area; the district has become a major recreational location, and the number of tourists has rapidly increased. To satisfy tourist demands, businesses have diligently created recreational environments featuring various characteristics. To prevent altering the natural environmental, fringe townships must be reconstructed based on ecocity concepts and methods. Thus, tourists' cognitive, emotional, and overall impressions of the Wulai District are integrated into the local ecological environment. Through the ecocity concept and the construction of environmental systems, recommendations for transforming the Wulai District into a major tourist attraction are provided in this study. The recommendations include reconstructing landscapes and developing tourism, fulfilling tourist demands, fulfilling the living space requirements of the local residents, reducing the influences associated with tourist development, fulfilling pedestrian, transportation, and parking requirements, integrating local open spaces through systematic and quality planning, preserving and maintaining local historical landscapes, constructing exceptional streets and urban landscapes, and linking neighboring attractions to effectively integrate tourism resources.

To discover these potential exchanges, this article extends the analysis of local industrial symbiosis to a national scale. A waste input-output table, which is a material flow accounting tool, was compiled and used as a database to examine the existing exchanges of by-products. The supplies and demands of industrial wastes or by-products were compared to highlight their potential use for promoting higher exchange flows. The analysis of the linkages indicated that the majority of each of the by-products were reused by the few industries that had the technology and operational capacity for reuse. This finding is useful for determining which industries are good candidates for promoting further industrial symbiosis (IS). Based on a nation-wide analysis that considered the industrial characteristics of Taiwan comprehensively, 23 types of major by-products with greater reuse flows and 216 potential exchange patterns were identified between the industries. In addition, three types of eco-industrial networks were characterized as follows according to their dominant types: (1) fossil fuel, metal, and mineral-dominated; (2) agricultural and synthetic material-dominated; and (3) information and communications technology (ICT) and chemical industry-dominated eco-industrial networks.

The 205 international publications on district heating by Chinese scientists published until 2013 have been mapped and summarised with respect to demand, supply, technology, market and environment. More diversified heat supply with renewable source was grasping the Chinese interest, since many new systems have been established, having more degrees of freedom when choosing various heat supply and technology options.

Twenty years of industrial symbiosis research has provided ample evidence and experience how to close material and energy cycles in industrial systems. The more recent urban symbiosis literature develops a similar perspective and experience on closing waste resource cycles for a different social system: cities. An urban symbiosis analysis on how to close urban waste resource cycles has to focus on geographical boundaries, local partnerships, and policy interventions. In conducting a detailed case study of Rotterdam Energy Approach and Planning (REAP), this paper aims to identify how urban actors, notably local authorities, can facilitate improved urban resource management to mitigate climate change. REAP incorporates energy and water reuse in an urban area, using by-products as resources in different urban functions. It is coordinated by Rotterdam's local authority, in partnership with architects and academic institutions in its design, and housing corporations and energy companies in its implementation. The methodology to assess REAP includes a review of policy documents, site visits and in-depth interviews. This study revealed the central role of local authorities in governing urban symbiosis projects like REAP; the need for increased private-sector participation in the design stage of such projects; and the necessity to encourage dialogue, learning and flexibility in the governance of urban resource management.

The assessment combines (i) a harmonized techno-economic analysis of conversion pathways expected to be certified for use in commercial aviation by 2020, (ii) a pioneer plant analysis taking into account technological immaturity, and (iii) a quantified assessment of the merits of co-producing RJF alongside existing European supply chains in the pulp, wheat ethanol, and beet sugar industries. None of the pathways assessed are able to reach price parity with petroleum-derived jet fuel in the short term. The pioneer plant analysis suggests that the hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) pathway is currently the best option; the technology achieves the lowest minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) of 29.3 (sic) GJ(-1) (1289 (sic) t(-1)) and the technology is deployed on commercial scale already. In the short term, nth plant analysis shows hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) and pyrolysis emerging as promising alternatives, yielding MFSPs of 21.4 (sic) GJ(-1) (939 (sic) t(-1)) and 30.2 (sic) GJ(-1) (1326 (sic) t(-1)), respectively. The pioneer plant analysis shows considerable MFSP increases for producing drop-in fuels using HTL and pyrolysis as both technologies are relatively immature. Hence, further RD\&D efforts into these pathways are recommended. Co-production strategies decrease the MFSP by 4-8\% compared to greenfield production. Integration of process units and material and energy flows is expected to lead to further cost reductions. As such, co-production can be a particularly useful strategy to progress emerging technologies to commercial scale. (C) 2015 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd},

The proposed upgrading method is based on the idea of coupling two processes developed in a previous project. The first process consists in the direct removal of carbon dioxide from the biogas through direct carbonation of bottom ash, while the second in CO2 absorption with alkali solutions that are regenerated through contact with air pollution control residues. The results of the experimental tests showed that the process is able to effectively produce biomethane (i.e. a gas with a CH4 content {\textgreater} 96 \% vol.). The advantages of applying the combined process instead of one of the two techniques in terms of the decrease of residues requirement was assessed. For the combined process the specific requirements of residues resulted, respectively of 84 kg of bottom ash and 0.6 kg of air pollution control residues per each Nm(3) of biomethane produced, allowing to achieve almost twofold and a 20-fold reduction of the requirements, respectively, if separate processes were applied. Economic assessment indicated that the combined process may prove to be less costly with respect to direct carbonation if the treated BA cannot be reused.},

Since the primary role of European flock is meat production, sheep are crossbreds not graded for fine wool production. Their wool is very coarse and contains a lot of kemps (dead fibres), so that it is practically unserviceable for textile uses, and represents a by-product which is mostly disposed off. Green hydrolysis using superheated water is an emerging technology to turn waste wool into amendment-fertilizers for the management of grasslands and other cultivation purposes. In this way wool keratin (the wool protein) is degraded into simpler compounds, tailoring the release speed of nutrients to plants. Wool, when added to the soil, increases the yield of grass grown, absorbs and retains moisture very effectively and reduces run off of contaminants such as pesticides. Moreover, the closed-loop cycle grass-wool-grass is an efficient form of recycling, because the wool-grass step is solar powered and grazing sheep increases soil carbon sequestration on grasslands and fertilisation, if not over-used, can enhance the carbon sequestration rate. Economical results of using hydrolysed wool as a fertilizer are expected from the increase of the management yield and the extension of the pasture lands that may contribute to employment and profit of sheep farming, increase European sheep population, and reduce European dependency of imported meat which is forecast to rise in the next years.},

However, quantitative data on building energy performance as a function of urban density, building compactness and orientation, building use and supply options are rarely available during the design of new cities or early scenario analysis for existing city quarters, making it difficult for cities to effectively evaluate which concepts work today and in the future. The paper proposes a methodology to assess the energy demand and supply options as a function of the availability of geometry, building standard and use data. An automated procedure was implemented to identify each building's geometry and volume and transfer the information to a simulation tool, which then calculates heating demand and solar energy generation on roofs and facades. The simulation includes shading calculations for each segment of the facades and roofs and thus allows a very detailed quantification of the building energy demand. By applying the methodology to a case study city quarter designed in an urban competition in Munich, it could be shown how the urban design influences the energy demand of the quarter and which fractions of renewable energy can be integrated into the roofs. While the building insulation standard and use are the is most important criteria for building energy efficiency (with an impact of more than a factor 2), the exact geometrical form, compactness and urban shading effects influences the energy demand by 10-20\%. On the other hand, the detailed roof geometry and orientation influences the possible solar coverage of electricity or thermal needs. Zero energy city quarters with solar resources alone are only possible when all available building surface areas are fully optimized and do not need to fulfill other requirements such as providing roof gardens, terraces or others. Combinations with other more centralized renewable resources such as deep geothermal, solar or biomass heat or cogeneration plants are often necessary to achieve zero energy balances.

	abstract = {Climate change and its social, environmental, economic and ethical consequences are widely recognized as the major set of interconnected problems facing human societies. Its impacts and costs will be large, serious, and unevenly spread, globally for decades. The main factor causing climate change and global warming is the increase of global carbon emissions produced by human activities such as deforestation and burning of fossil fuels. In this special volume, the articles mainly focus on investigations of technical innovations and policy interventions for improved energy efficiency and carbon emissions reduction in a wide diversity of industrial, construction and agricultural sectors at different scales, from the smallest scales (firm or household), cities, regional, to national and global scales. Some articles in this special volume assess alternative carbon emissions reduction approaches, such as carbon capture and storage and geoengineering schemes. Given the high cost and internal/external uncertainties of carbon capture and storage and risks and side effects of various geoengineering schemes, improved energy efficiency and widespread implementation of low fossil-carbon renewable-energy based systems are clearly the most direct and effective approaches to reduce carbon emissions. This means that we have to radically transform our societal metabolism towards low/no fossil-carbon economies. However, design and implementation of low/no fossil-carbon production will require fundamental changes in the design, production and use of products and these needed changes are evolving but much more needs to be done. Additionally, the design and timing of suitable climate policy interventions, such as various carbon taxation/trading schemes, must be integral in facilitating the development of low fossil carbon products and accelerating the transition to post-fossil carbon societies.

	abstract = {The synergic treatment benefit of reducing the amount of raw material and fuel and its contribution to the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) total emissions are of great interest for cement manufacturing. Additionally, it should be considered that the major sources of GHG in clinker production are CO2 from the calcination of raw materials and CO2 from fossil fuel combustion. Calcination CO2 can be reduced by the substitution of raw materials with noncarbonated calcium sources. Taking into account its potential reduction effect, a comprehensive research in the use of sewage sludge as a raw material alternative in clinker production, is required and is likely to provide valuable improvement. An emergy analysis to evaluate the synergic reduction effect of urban sewage sludge use as alternative raw material or fuel in clinker production was carried out. The main steps of the synergic treatment process, namely (1) sewage sludge treatment and (2) its transport to clinker production, were assessed by means of the emergy accounting approach. This evaluation aimed to assess the environmental resource demand in terms of equivalent solar energy, extending the energy quality hierarchy principle froth ecosystems to eco-industrial process. The achievable synergic reduction effects, in terms of alternative raw material or fuel and recycling process, due to four different scenarios of sludge treatment and energy recycling, are analyzed in this study. The resulting unit emergy values of cement were compared with previous emergy assessments in order to highlight how emergy analysis is sensitive to local context and reference system's boundaries. Emergy Yield Ratio (EYR) with and without accounting for additional emergy investment due to damages caused by the process were calculated and discussed as comprehensive indicators of process sustainability. Results show that if the environmental impact is accounted for, the EYR drops significantly, thus suggesting that polluting emissions greatly increase the system's demand for additional resources from outside to repair damage and replace lost natural and human-made capital (the latter amounting to about 10\% of the total emergy investment). The use of emergy accounting and LCA provides indices that allow a quantitative metrics of eco-industrial sustainability and environmental impact reduction. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Since about 2006, they have increased rapidly in popularity. They now go by many names: ecodistricts, ecoquartiers, eco-cities, zero/low-carbon/carbon-positive cities, ecopolises, ecobarrios, One Planet Communities, and solar cities. They have become framessometimes the dominant frameused to orient the construction of new pieces of a city in a growing number of countries. Despite numerous standardization efforts, the field of ecourban neighbourhood planning and practice lacks a consistent cross-cultural understanding of what constitutes meaningful ecourbanism in specific economic, political, ecological, social, and design-based terms. Ecourban neighbourhood projects also respond to strictly local challenges and opportunities and express themselves in fragmented ways in different contexts. This article presents an original typology of ecourbanism as the integration of seven extreme type principles. We developed this typology through an abductive approach, or the back and forth testing of observed practices with arguments advanced in theories of sustainable development, planning and urban studies. While ecourban neighbourhood developments by definition express integrative goals, this typology permits assessment of the extent to which outcomes are being achieved in terms of each specific principle. We define and present a limiting case for each of these extreme type principles. Rather than attempting to render different standards equivalent across national contexts, this typology-based approach to understand the outcomes of ecourban neighbourhood developments promises a means to facilitate orienting these developments toward higher levels of integration within a common set of principled boundaries, as they are developed around the world.},

Unfortunately, OMWE's also have challenges. First, sellers may have access to other disposal options and, as a result, may not fully commit to the exchange. Second, buyers can face high uncertainty about the product exchanged and the transaction being undertaken. Overcoming these challenges is the last hurdle to making OMWEs successful. This study investigates the factors that reduce the buyers' uncertainty and increase the sellers' commitment to the OMWE. We analyze novel transaction-level data from an online exchange (MNExchange.org) combined with other archival public records on county-level repurposing and disposal statistics. First, we find that regional repurposing policies and alternatives have a complementary effect on sellers' commitment toward OMWEs, resulting in increased OMWE exchanges. However, regional disposal policies and alternatives have a substitution effect on sellers' commitment, resulting in reduced exchange success. Further, greater product and transaction information reduce the buyer's uncertainty and increase exchange success. Finally, the analysis shows that users' (buyers and sellers) heavily rely on their prior experience with OMWEs. Specifically, higher familiarity between the buyer-seller pair and familiarity with the OMWE system leads to higher likelihood of exchange success. This study lays the foundation for understanding OMWEs and has important implications for developing policies and operations to increase online transactions of by-products, materials and wastes.},

While initially (1979-1988), the area of Tianjin's salt pan increased, later (1988-2013) it declined dramatically. In the first phase (1979-1988) of the studied period the primary roll-in landscape of the salt pan wasbarren land with an area of 60.0 km(2). By 1988, the area of Tianjin's salt pan rose to 457.8 km(2). The main roll-out landscape of the salt pan during 1988-2013 was urban, barren land, village/town, harbor, and road whose area amounted to 69.8, 35.9, 27.3, 25.5 and 18.4 km(2) respectively. The roll-out barren land will be transformed to construction land ultimately. By 2013, the total loss reached 167.3 km(2), which was 36.5\% of the salt pan area of Tianjin in 1988. With the development of coastal economy, the salterns with a lower economic value were transformed to and replaced by land use types with a higher economic value. This trend would influence the production of sea salt and the development of sodium hydroxide and sodium carbonate industries. Seawater desalination provides an opportunity for the restoration and compensation of salt production capacity. Based on the theory of circular economy and industrial symbiosis, in this article an industrial symbiosis model for sea salt production and sea water desalination is explored: mariculture-power plant cooling-seawater desalination-Artemia culture-bromide extraction-sea salt production-salt chemical industry. Through the application of this process sustainable development of the sea salt production in Tianjin could be achieved.},

The exchange consists of an extensive online membership of donors and users and the presence of an active in-house brokering service helping with product placement. Operational data collected by the program between January 1, 2010 and June 30, 2013, were used to quantify the values of the indices. The NYCWM diverts an average of 623 tons of office furniture, containers and packaging and electronics from terminal disposal every year. The exchanges are typically linear and one-way, with a focus on waste materials. During the study period, of the 1823 listings posted by donors 63\% became complete exchanges (products that found users). The presence of a facilitator brokering and managing the exchanges was found to be essential to achieve large tonnage exchanges. Passive exchanges were substantially inferior in numbers and tonnage diverted from active exchanges throughout the study period. The geographic location of donors and users for 466 completed exchanges (42\% of the diverted weight) revealed that the mean travel distance was 17.7 km ranging from “zero” (donor and user located with the same zip code area) to 80 km, Nearly 70\% of the completed exchanges (half of the weight) occurred within a distance of 50 km. Any distances greater than 50 km involved wood pallets that were directed towards recycling by the users. The diversion goal of NYCWM, which focuses on tonnage diverted, strongly affects the quantity and type of resources exchanged, as well as the nature of the exchanges. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

It maps the national policy intent, which incorporated industry and academic expertise into a strategic policy vision. Then the local interpretation of this generic eco-town definition is reviewed, along with how the authoritative knowledge on innovative eco-planning is distilled into guidance. By revisiting the original eco-town objectives, comparing them with the recently published garden cities prospectus, the limitations for intra-national implementation of national policy frameworks are considered, asking whether any lessons have been incorporated in the current round of policy formation. The success or failure of such policy implementation is found to be more of a socio-political exercise than an empirical or rationalist process. The eco-towns were less an attempt to establish new forms of sustainable habitations than a political attempt to use eco-planning to justify new large-scale housing settlements.},

Thus sustainable transitions research emphasizes co-evolutionary approaches involving a multitude of actors including the business sector, the government, and academia. Academic research can catalyse sustainable transitions by critically analyse current societal trends to develop and disseminate new knowledge. At research conferences, researchers and practitioners meet to network and discuss recent research findings providing arenas for testing and evaluating ideas to enhance sustainable transitions. This however requires some modifications of the standard design of a research conference. Here we report learning outcomes from experimenting at the 18th international Greening of Industry Network conference during 21-24 October 2012 in Linkoping, Sweden. The conference was a combination of a traditional conference structure with different interactive elements such as sustainability jam-sessions to discuss future challenges of six companies and clusters of companies at their site. The intention of doing so was to enhance learning outcomes both for visiting conference delegates and among actors in the host region. This was perceived by the participants as an innovative approach fostering both problem solving and creation of new ideas. Four out of the six companies continued dialogues about sustainable production fields or bio-refineries with Linkoping University. In addition we introduce and summarize research findings presented at the conference which were further developed into research articles. The essence of these articles covers sustainable industry management; cleaner production; industrial ecology; cooperation between industry, governments and academics; dissemination of concepts and technologies; methods and tools for modelling and measuring of industrial symbiosis, CO2 performance and eco-efficiency.

Linkoping municipality, 1976 [kommunfullmaktige] Motion om utredning angaende eldrivna fordon. Dnr 1976.278. Using concepts from multi-level perspectives and sociotechnical perspectives on system builders, the study focuses on three time periods: During the first time period (1976-1994), a niche for biogas developed amongst dedicated actors in small networks representing energy and public transport within the municipality. That is, biogas was entirely connected to the vision of a `green' public transport. Second, between the years of 1994 and 2001, the biogas producing company acted as a system builder and initiated a large-scale biogas production through close cooperation in networks with other actors. As a result, biogas reached a phase of technological maturity and also gained some support from national investment programs. Finally, from 2001 the expansion of biogas became clearer as the biogas production spread into a regional arena but also reached for new customers, like personal cars. Unforeseen spin-offs like the formation of new private companies and development of research were important results of the transition. Thereby, the transition is a move towards a new socio-technical regime. A conclusion from the study is that the development of biogas was highly influenced by national support and pressure, but was mainly driven by local actors system builders that could steer the processes and had endurance as well as capability to mobilize resources in order to fulfill their purposes.

Based on the results, several additions are made to existing models of industrial symbiosis that describe the stages through which industrial symbiosis develops. The first addition is the idea that industrial symbiosis can be understood to build on stable intermediate components that develop autonomously from each other. The second addition is that the development of industrial symbiosis itself can be understood as a stable intermediate for more comprehensive developments at a higher system level. The third addition is that the development of industrial symbiosis can be understood to be embedded in a larger social context that influences the opportunities that actors see for collective action towards industrial symbiosis.

	abstract = {Cement production contributes to extensive CO2 emissions. However, the climate impact can vary significantly between different production systems and different types of cement products. The market is dominated by ordinary Portland cement, which is based on primary raw materials and commonly associated with combustion of vast amounts of fossil fuels. Therefore, the production of Portland cement can be described as a rather linear process. But there are alternative options, for example, involving large amounts of industrial byproducts and renewable energy which are more cyclic and thus can be characterized as relatively “synergistic”. The main purpose of this article is to study how relevant the leading ideas of industrial symbiosis are for the cement industry based on a quantitative comparison of the CO2 emissions from different cement production systems and products, both existing and hypothetical. This has been done by studying a group of three cement plants in Germany, denoted as Cluster West, and the production of cement clinker and three selected cement products. Based on this analysis and literature, it is discussed to what extent industrial symbiosis options can lead to reduced CO2 emissions, for Cluster West and the cement industry in general. Utilizing a simplified LCA model (”cradle to gate”), it was shown that the CO2 emissions from Cluster West declined by 45\% over the period 1997-2009, per tonne of average cement. This was mainly due to a large share of blended cement, i.e., incorporation of byproducts from local industries as supplementary cementitious materials. For producers of Portland cement to radically reduce the climate impact it is necessary to engage with new actors and find fruitful cooperation regarding byproducts, renewable energy and waste heat. Such a development is very much in line with the key ideas of industrial ecology and industrial symbiosis, meaning that it appears highly relevant for the cement industry to move further in this direction. From a climate perspective, it is essential that actors influencing the cement market acknowledge the big difference between different types of cement, where an enlarged share of blended cement products (substituting clinker with byproducts such as slag and fly ash) offers a great scope for future reduction of CO2 emissions.

	abstract = {Cement production is among the largest anthropogenic sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) and there is considerable pressure on the cement industry to reduce these emissions. In the effort to reduce CO2 emissions, there is a need for methods to systematically identify, classify and assess different improvement measures, to increase the knowledge about different options and prioritize between them. For this purpose a framework for assessment has been developed, inspired by common approaches within the fields of environmental systems analysis and industrial symbiosis. The aim is to apply a broad systems perspective and through the use of multiple criteria related to technologies and organization strategies facilitate informed decision-making regarding different CO2 performance measures in the cement industry. The integrated assessment framework consists of two parts: a generic and a case-specific part. It is applied to a cement production cluster in Germany called Cluster West, consisting of three cement plants owned by CEMEX. The framework can be used in different ways. It can be used as a tool to perform literature reviews and categorize the state-of-the-art knowledge about options to improve the CO2 performance. It can also be used to assess options for the cement industry in general as well as for individual plants. This paper describes the assessment framework, the ideas behind it, its components and the process of carrying out the assessment. The first part provides a structured overview of the options for improvement for the cement industry in general, while the second part is a case-specific application for Cluster West, providing information about the feasibility for different categories of measures that can reduce the CO2 emissions. The overall impression from the project is that the framework was successfully established and, when applied, facilitated strategic discussions and decision-making. Such frameworks can be utilized to systematically assess hundreds of different measures and identify the ones most feasible and applicable for implementation, within the cement industry but also possibly in other sectors. The results demonstrated that even in a relatively synergistic and efficient production system, like Cluster West, there are opportunities for improvement, especially if options beyond “production efficiency” are considered.

	abstract = {Industrial symbiosis (IS) developments have been differentiated as self-organized, facilitated, and planned. This article introduces a tool, Looplocal, which has been built with objectives to support the strategic facilitation of IS. Looplocal is a visualization tool built to assist in 1) Simplifying the identification of regions susceptible to new industrial symbiosis facilitation activities 2) Enabling proactive and targeted marketing of potential exchanges to key actors in specific regions and 3) Assisting facilitators to assess the various strategies and consequential engagement and analysis methodologies suitable for additional IS development in specific regions. The tool compares industrial symbiosis data and estimated regional material and energy flows (on a facility level) to identify potential IS transfer information along with key stakeholder and network data. The authors have performed a proof of concept run of this tool on Sweden. In its early stages of application the method has given results seen as useful for identifying regions susceptible to the investment of symbiosis facilitators' time and resources. The material focus and customization possibilities for the tool show potential for a spectrum of potential facilitators: from waste management companies to national or regional authorities. In conjunction with long term business models, such a tool might be utilized throughout an adaptive chain of facilitation activities and aims. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Yet, few EIPs have seen successful operational implementation, especially if they begin as standard industrial parks. Rapid economic growth, commensurate with increasing environmental damage in China, has resulted in officials' further pursuing EIP policy as a significant element of the broader circular economy and ecological modernization efforts. This article examines the barriers for EIP development from industrial park senior manager perspectives. Using resource dependence theory and the resource-based view as theoretical lenses, we investigate the external and internal barriers for EIP development in 51 Chinese industrial parks. A number of barriers are identified and grouped through a factor analysis. Cluster analysis is utilized to help categorize and evaluate the perceived levels of barriers and hardships experienced by various senior officials that manage the EIPs. It is found that few respondents encounter no significant barriers. Barriers related to technological development and capacity building are the most prevalent. These results highlight the relative importance of various activities that may be necessary by policy makers and other stakeholders to overcome the barriers. For example, cooperation in developing technological solutions for EIPs seems to be a major thrust that should be pursued by EIP development stakeholders. Other policy and managerial insights based on the general findings of this study are also presented.},

These technologies will contribute to companies' strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from fossils fuels. However, less effort has been spent on evaluating another interesting option after carbon capture: carbon utilisation or reuse. A feasibility study regarding an Italian industrial district is discussed: the district is characterised by the nearby locations of a CO2 producer (i.e. an natural gas combined cycle power plant) and a CO2 user (i.e. a sugar factory). The annual average CO2 emission by the power plant is about 1.7 million tonnes. Under current conditions the sugar factory `produces' CO2 to use it in the sugar refining process; thus, the idea is to evaluate the feasibility of capturing CO2 emitted from the power plant and reusing it in the sugar factory process from both a technological and an economic point of view. The results indicated a cost saving of about 42\% in the operational costs of the sugar factory due to the introduction of the carbon reuse technology. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Reforestation of eucalyptus appears as a viable alternative for mitigating these carbon emissions, leveraging their high productivity to that of other leading countries in the market, such as Finland and Sweden. This study aims to develop a model for monitoring and evaluating forest growth and quantifying wood stocks and sequestered carbon. System dynamics was used to simulate forest growth. Forest growth was modeled from eight regions with dissimilar edaphoclimatic characteristics, in the state of Minas Gerais, in Brazil. The model was sensitive enough to the characteristics of the regions, where the difference in forest stocks was 45.1\% at the end of 30 years in a harvest cycle of 7 years. It was found that the typical harvest cycle in practice by leading companies did not always yield a higher sequestered CO2 accumulated stock. By shortening the harvest cycle, it was possible to obtain a gain of up to 21.0\% in the sequestered CO2 stock. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {An evaluation of the investment required to implement a second generation bioethanol production chain is presented in this study. An integrated agro-industrial system can be an appropriate solution to accomplish the European requirement for the partial substitution of bioethanol for gasoline by 2020. A biorefinery system is hypothesized within the Province of Siena (Italy), fed by residual energy and material flows from local productions: straw from agriculture and residual geothermal heat from geothermal electricity generation; the output is calibrated to replace 10\% of gasoline consumption within the Provincial area. The physical consistency of the investment required to implement the production process, as well as the benefit of the biofuel gasoline substitution, have been evaluated by means of the emergy methodology. Emergy is a thermodynamics-based indicator that contributes to identify and measure all the inputs supporting a given system, expressed in a common unit (solar emergy joules semi). Results show that the benefit of saving gasoline, in emergy terms, almost doubles the emergy investment to produce biofuel. The case of a biorefinery fed by natural gas instead of local residual geothermal heat is also presented. The Unit Emergy Investment (UEI) of bioethanol produced in a biorefinery that uses residual straw and geothermal heat is 9.16E + 08 semj/g (the case of the Province of Siena); it is 1.84E + 09 semj/g (in case natural gas is used to fuel the process). Finally, the comparison between the UEI of bioethanol evaluated in this study and UEV of bioethanol calculated in other studies is presented. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This article combines the theoretical field of Industrial Symbiosis (IS) with a business model perspective to increase the knowledge about drivers and barriers behind the emergence of excess heat supply collaborations between district heating companies and industrial firms. The increased knowledge is gained by identifying and examining drivers and barriers associated with collaborative efforts to funnel excess heat produced by industrial firms into district heating grids in Sweden. An increased recovery of excess heat has the potential to reduce the primary energy demands of district heating systems. This study examines both existing and potential developments of industrial collaborations of excess heat-based district heating systems. The focus of the study consists of two Swedish cases of existing collaboration between district heating companies and pulp and paper industries as well as 16 industrial firms that all produce unused excess heat as a by-product. Confirming earlier research results, this study shows that financial issues are both the main drivers and the main barriers behind the emergence and development of inter-organisational collaborations. In addition, this study confirms earlier research that found the trust, joint problem solving, and fine-grained information transfer are important elements of successful collaboration. This study complements and clarifies these three features by including honesty and shared visions on common goals as important qualities needed for well-functioning collaborations. Combining the IS and the business model perspective has made it possible to examine more factors related to collaboration. The business model perspective has contributed with knowledge about central components of the business agreement between the collaborating parties, and the IS-perspective has contributed knowledge of the important organisational factors behind the emergence and development of long-term sustainable business agreements between firms.

I argue that Greater Boston's population of small- and medium-sized high-tech enterprises offers a systemic form of opportunity creation and enacting processes for industrial innovation. But they do not do so alone. The population of enterprises is embedded in a regional industrial ecosystem that facilitates ongoing reshuffling of the region's expertise, technology capabilities and financial resources for not only a single company but for a cluster of companies to grow fast. The concept of a regional industrial ecosystem suggests a locality analogous to Darwin's `small area' in which a `manufactory of species' is active but applied to the emergence, coadaptation, and growth of diverse sectors.

However, the idea is more often celebrated than critically interrogated. Analysis shows the concept circulates as an idea and ideal, exemplified by industrial symbiosis and extended product life. Yet, its actual enactment is limited and fragile. Instead, circular economies are achieved mostly through global recycling networks which are the primary means by which wastes are recovered as resources. European policies eschew these circuits. Resource recovery through global recycling networks is regarded as a dirty and illegal trade. In its place, EU circular economies attempt to transform wastes into resources within the boundaries of the EU. Through an analysis of two case studies of resource recovery in the United Kingdom, we highlight the challenges that confront making circular economies within the EU, showing that these are borne of a conjuncture of politically created markets, material properties and morally defined materials circuits. We show resource recovery in the EU to be framed by moral economies, driven by discourses of ecological modernization, environmental justice and resource (in)security, the last of which connects to China's resource-intensive development.},

The paper will consider the influence of Hofmann and Fischer on the shaping of national scientific institutions in Germany, from founding of the German Chemical Society in 1867 to the first institutes of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society founded in 1911, their academic leadership in other areas including the shaping of a successful academic-industrial symbiosis in organic chemistry, and finally their response to war as a force disruptive of scientific internationalism. All of these developments posed serious dilemmas, exacerbated by emerging strains of nationalism and anti-Semitism in German society. Whereas Hofmann's lifework came to a relatively successful end in 1892, Fischer was not so fortunate, as the war brought him heavy responsibilities and terrible personal losses, but with no German victory and no peace of reconciliation - a bleak end for Fischer and the 19th-century liberal ideals that had inspired him.},

The use of C-H-O as the basis for integration creates numerous opportunities for synergism because C, H, and O are the primary building blocks for many industrial compounds that can be exchanged and integrated. A particularly attractive feature of the CHOSYN framework is its ability to use atomic-based targets to establish benchmarks for the design of macroscopic systems involving multiple processes. Several structural representations, benchmarking, and optimization formulations are developed to embed potential CHOSYN configurations of interest and to synthesize cost-effective networks.

The strategy is composed of three parts: the model of EV feasible charging region, the mechanism of dynamical event triggering, and the algorithm of real-time power allocation for EVs. Furthermore, in order to lower the cost of computation resource, the strategy is designed to operate without forecasting on photovoltaic output or EV charging demand.

First, the authors interpret the rhetoric of recycling and sustainability mobilised by Japanese interests to facilitate Asian trade in hazardous wastes, creating what detractors say is a pernicious form of waste colonialism'. Next, the researchers scrutinise the discursively linked creation in Japan, since 2001, of a network of state-of-the-art WEEE processing facilities, in particular Panasonic's flagship PETEC, which they studied in 2013. They then turn to the protean material flows and the makeshift configurations engendered by e-waste itself - not only pollutant when scavenged but frequently lucrative and welcome in de-manufacturing hotspots in China - and analyse the circulation of scavenged resources' in the researchers' fieldsite in the world's most notorious e-waste processing node, in Guangdong Province, where the team conducted ethnographic fieldwork intermittently during 2012-13. China's grand initiative of converting to state-controlled formal processing, with Panasonic's assistance, facilitates a cross-cultural comparison of tensions between formal and informal conversion against the backdrop of the flawed Basel Convention regime, relevant to a range of societies. The paper argues that a relatively neutral' ethnographic approach to e-waste furnishes significant insight into thorny issues surrounding reckonings of risk and value in varying contexts and responses from those actually immersed in the processing trade, yielding important policy perspective.},

Most methods account for the demand for ecosystem services, but almost none account for the supply. Incomplete accounting of the very foundation of human well-being can result in perverse outcomes from decisions meant to enhance sustainability and lost opportunities for benefiting from the ability of nature to satisfy human needs in an economically and environmentally superior manner. This paper develops a framework for understanding and designing synergies between technological and ecological systems to encourage greater harmony between human activities and nature. This framework considers technological systems ranging from individual processes to supply chains and life cycles, along with corresponding ecological systems at multiple spatial scales ranging from local to global. The demand for specific ecosystem services is determined from information about emissions and resource use, while the supply is obtained from information about the capacity of relevant ecosystems. Metrics calculate the sustainability of individual ecosystem services at multiple spatial scales and help define necessary but not sufficient conditions for local and global sustainability. Efforts to reduce ecological overshoot encourage enhancement of life cycle efficiency, development of industrial symbiosis, innovative designs and policies, and ecological restoration, thus combining the best features of many existing methods. Opportunities for theoretical and applied research to make this framework practical are also discussed.},

Some projections for global population suggest that it will peak this century. Waste generation rates per capita generally increase with affluence, although in the most affluent countries there is also a trend toward dematerialization. The confluence of these factors means that at some point in the future total global waste generation could possibly peak. To determine when peak waste might occur, we used the shared-socioeconomic pathway scenarios (used in Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC] studies) combined with estimates of municipal solid waste (MSW) generation rates, extrapolated from our work for the World Bank. Despite the expectation that total MSW generation in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and high-income countries will peak mid-century, with current trajectories global peak waste is not expected before 2100. The peak could be moved forward to around 2075 and reduced in intensity by some 30\% if a more aggressive sustainability growth scenario were followed, rather than the current business-as-usual scenario. Further, the magnitude of peak waste is sensitive to the intensity of waste generation; it could vary from 7.3 to 10.9 megatonnes per day under the sustainability scenario. The timing of peak waste will substantially depend on the development of cities in Sub-Saharan Africa, where population growth rates are more than double the rest of the world.},

However, given the fact that most wireless sensor devices are resource constrained and operate on batteries, the communication overhead and power consumption are therefore important issues for WSNs design. In order to efficiently manage these wireless sensor devices in a unified manner, the industrial authorities should be able to provide a network infrastructure supporting various WSN applications and services that facilitate the management of sensor-equipped real-world entities. This paper presents an overview of industrial ecosystem, technical architecture, industrial device management standards, and our latest research activity in developing a WSN management system. The key approach to enable efficient and reliable management of WSN within such an infrastructure is a cross-layer design of lightweight and cloud-based RESTful Web service.},

	abstract = {This paper explores the effects and underlying intentions of Swedish practices of exporting sustainable development models to Chinese ecocities. Under the `bestpractice' banner, international architectural firms are often invited to masterplan ecocity developments. The `sustainable city' has thus become an export commodity, supported by the Swedish government and seen as especially suited to the Chinese ecocity market. Two cases are examined, where Swedish architecture firms have been commissioned to masterplan Chinese ecocities: the Caofedian and Wuxi Eco-cities. In particular, I examine three kinds of `effects': first, the planning discourse manifested in the planning documents; second, how these plans materialize on the ground; and, third, the effects of this exported planning practice on Swedish policy and practice at home. This paper advances our understanding of how transnational urban sustainability practices are constructed and circulated. It further adds to the field of planning mobilities by examining not only the discourse and diffusion of transnational master planning but also how the `export' circulates and returns. I argue that the two intentional logics of exporting the Swedish `sustainable city'-to shape a better world and to export clean-tech products-could both be seen as having failed in these two cases. Instead, the naming and branding of the ecocities seem to boost a certain repetitive problematic idea and practice of sustainable urban development. I argue that the Swedish exported practice strengthens and legitimizes a circulating narrative establishing a sustainable urban planning practice fostering a paradoxically generic image of upper-middle-class consumers as ecocity inhabitants in China as well as in Sweden.},

Therefore, a better understanding of the sources and characteristics of particulate matters (PM) and associated elements is crucial and urgent for haze controlling. In this study, air particulates were collected from six different functional areas in a megacity of the YRD, China in early winter of 2012. Highly time- and size-resolved analysis of PM-elements was conducted to trace their sources. Our results showed that the main donors to particulate elements were crustal dust, followed by traffic and industrial influences due to the mixed residential, commercial and industrial zones at most sites. Anthropogenesis contributed more to the sources of finer particles and associated elements than those of coarser ones. Besides the local emission sources, meteorological conditions also affected the distribution patterns of ambient elements. Furthermore, the risks of hazard metals in PM2.5 and PM1.0 to human health were estimated. The highest non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks were observed at urban living quarter (ULQ) and eco-industrial park (EIP), respectively. In addition, the general risks at rural living quarters (RLQ) were the lowest. Results from this study may provide valuable information for air pollution control and management in the YRD, China.

This paper also proposes a method for visualizing the integration process in order to uncover its dynamics. The typology as well as the visual mapping tool is applied to an empirical case. The analysis shows that six forms of integration exist. It also shows that systems integration is dynamic and highlights that systems integration sometimes requires systems that bridge others.

In this context, the industrial symbiosis aims to reach sustainability by closing productive cycles, where the residues from an industry are the raw material for others. Agri-food residues are important sources of compounds with commercial interest that could be recovered both to decrease the volume of residues generated, and also to improve the economic viability of processes, by producing added value products. For this purpose, several applications of the supercritical technology to add value to agri-food residues through both extraction of high value-added compounds and hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass to produce fermentable sugars are presented.

This is usually made in order to add value, reduce costs, and improve the environment, and therefore has been taken as an effective approach for developing an eco-industrial park, improving resource efficiency, and reducing pollutant emission. Most conventional evaluation approaches ignored the contribution of natural ecosystem to the development of industrial symbiosis and cannot reveal the interrelations between economic development and environmental protection, leading to a need of an innovative evaluation method. Under such a circumstance, we present an emergy analysis-based evaluation method by employing a case study at Shenyang Economic and Technological Development Zone (SETDZ). Specific emergy indicators on industrial symbiosis, including emergy savings and emdollar value of total emergy savings, were developed so that the holistic picture of industrial symbiosis can be presented. Research results show that nonrenewable inputs, imported resource inputs, and associated services could be saved by 89.3, 32.51, and 15.7 \%, and the ratio of emergy savings to emergy of the total energy used would be about 25.58 \%, and the ratio of the emdollar value of total emergy savings to the total gross regional product (GRP) of SETDZ would be 34.38 \% through the implementation of industrial symbiosis. In general, research results indicate that industrial symbiosis could effectively reduce material and energy consumption and improve the overall eco-efficiency. Such a method can provide policy insights to industrial park managers so that they can raise appropriate strategies on developing eco-industrial parks. Useful strategies include identifying more potential industrial symbiosis opportunities, optimizing energy structure, increasing industrial efficiency, recovering local ecosystems, and improving public and industrial awareness of eco-industrial park policies.},

A case study is based on a new building development in North West Bicester Eco Town, Oxfordshire, consisting of 393 homes, community and commercial units. Using simulation models and real domestic load measurements, the results show potential for demand management and energy storage. With a sensitivity analysis, the paper discusses also related energy policy aspects such as options for PV orientation aspects, the use of Electric Vehicles (EVs), the potential of Direct Current electrical installations and schemes that encourage load shifting. The paper concludes, within the context of the case study, assumptions and scenarios that, contrary to what is commonly believed, high penetration of PVs in a development area is feasible and may even reduce grid infrastructure costs.

	abstract = {The design of energy systems has become an issue all over the world. A single optimal system cannot be suggested because the availability of infrastructure and resources and the acceptability of the system should be discussed locally, involving all related stakeholders in the energy system. In particular, researchers and engineers of technologies related to energy systems should be able to perform the forecasting and roadmapping of future energy systems and indicate quantitative results of scenario analyses. We report an energy flow model developed for analysing scenarios of future Japanese energy systems implementing a variety of feasible technology options. The model was modularized and represented as functionals of appropriate technology options, which enables the aggregation and disaggregation of energy systems by defining functionals for single technologies, packages integrating multi-technologies, and mini-systems such as regions implementing industrial symbiosis. Based on the model, the combinations of technologies on both energy supply and demand sides can be addressed considering not only the societal scenarios such as resource prices, economic growth and population change but also the technical scenarios including the development and penetration of energy-related technologies such as distributed solid oxide fuel cells in residential sectors and new-generation vehicles, and the replacement and shift of current technologies such as heat pumps for air conditioning and centralized power generation. The developed model consists of two main modules; namely, a power generation dispatching module for the Japanese electricity grid and a demand-side energy flow module based on a sectorial energy balance table. Both modules are divided and implemented as submodules represented as functionals of supply- and demand-side technology options. Using the developed model, three case studies were performed. Required data were collected through workshops involving researchers and engineers in the energy technology field in Japan. The functionals of technologies were defined on the basis of the availability of data and understanding of the current and future energy systems. Through case studies, it was demonstrated that the potential of energy technologies can be analysed by the developed model considering the mutual relationships of technologies. The contribution of technologies to, e.g., the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions should be carefully examined by quantitative analyses of interdependencies of the technology options.

Industrial and power plant-sourced waste heat is a significant potential resource for nearby sinks. However, because industrial facilities are not usually optimally located for waste heat utilization, most of the potential heat is emitted to the surrounding environment. To achieve the future targets of the efficient energy provision network system in the coastal regions of Fukushima that experienced tsunami devastation, this study developed a simulation process model integrating spatial analysis, technology systems, and land use controls to maximize the utilization of waste heat from coal-fired thermal power plants to nearby plant factories. Shinchi-town in Fukushima Prefecture was selected as a case study, in which an energy symbiosis network was being constructed. Our findings indicated that the waste heat system provided more environmental benefits than the individual boiler system. With waste heat utilization, fuel oil consumption is reduced by 16.05 Tliyear, while total CO2 emissions are reduced by 1204 ton/year. In addition, as economic feasibility depends on the distance between the power plant and the factory, cost-effective areas with regards to heat supply were identified based on cost-benefit analysis and geographic information system techniques. Finally, policy implications to support the construction of an energy symbiosis network are proposed and discussed. Such a resolution with energy symbiosis and waste heat utilization would shed light on the Japanese energy dilemma. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In our previous study, we proposed a “smart recycling system” that utilizes existing industrial facilities with higher energy efficiency so that a cost-effective and robust recycling system for treating municipal wastes can be established. In this study, we further develop the concept of smart recycling and propose a framework for facilitating the implementation of such a system. By making use of existing facilities and adopting both closed-loop and semi-closed-loop recycling processes, this system allows flexible adaptations on the changes of external factors. A spatially optimal scale is necessary to meet the requirements for such a smart recycling system. Thus, we develop an integrated model that combines both geographical information system based collection model and a process model for a smart recycling center. In order to test its applicability, we employ a case study approach to simulate the implementation of smart recycling in the three satellite cities of Tokyo Metropolitan Area and evaluate its effects under three different scenarios. Our simulation results show that smart recycling cannot only reduce carbon dioxide emission but also lower the overall costs. Also, by comparing with conventional waste incineration, we find that the unit cost of smart recycling is relatively stable to changes of the waste amounts due to its lower fixed costs for facilities.

Towards achieving these policies, this study evaluated the energy efficiency potential in the city, in collaboration with the district heating and electricity utility Fortum. Drawing on their vast billing meter data on the housing stock in Stockholm, a new understanding of energy use in the city emerged. Analysis of the energy efficiency potential of different building vintages revealed that the retrofitting potential of the building stock to current building codes would reduce heating energy use by one third. In terms of market segmentation, the greatest reduction potential in total energy was found to be for buildings constructed between 1946 and 1975. This is due to the large number of buildings constructed during that era and their poor energy performance. However, the least energy-efficient buildings were those built between 1926 and 1945 in contradiction to commonly held beliefs. These findings indicate the need for a shift in public policy towards the buildings with highest retrofitting potential. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {With the rapid urbanization, many cities are facing various environmental issues, resulting in local ecological degradation. It is critical to conduct a scientific assessment so that appropriate solutions can be found by considering the local realities. Many evaluation methods, such as emergy analysis, material flow analysis, data envelopment analysis and ecological footprint analysis, have been proposed. Among them, ecological footprint analysis has been applied as a useful policy and planning tool for evaluating urban sustainability. The aim of this paper is to evaluate two industrial cities by using ecological footprint method in Shenyang, China and Kawasaki, Japan. The two cities have been “friendship cities” for over 30 years and have similar industrial structures. In order to present a holistic evolution picture on their ecological footprints, we collected all the relevant data for the period of 1997-2009. The results show that Shenyang's ecological footprints experienced a significant increase, while such figures in Kawasaki were quite stable, but per capita figures in Shenyang were much less than those in Kawasaki, indicating that a gap between the two cities still exist. In order to further improve its sustainable development, Shenyang should closely collaborate with Kawasaki, learning Kawasaki's eco-town experiences and other environmental management experiences. In addition, Shenyang should also learn from other leading cities and try to optimize its industrial and energy structure and improve their citizens' environmental awareness so that it can move toward a more sustainable development direction.

	abstract = {In order to provide adequate engineering assistance and to improve the energy efficiency in process industries, it is crucial to evaluate the operational performance of a boiler in terms of its practical requirements, viz. temperature, pressure, and mass flow rate of steam. This study was aimed at assessing and optimizing the performance of a refuse plastic fuel-fired boiler using artificial neural networks. A feed-forward back propagation neural network model was developed and trained using existing plant data (5months), to predict temperature, pressure, and mass flow rate of steam, using the following input parameters: feed water pressure, feed water temperature, conveyor speed, and incinerator exit temperature. The predictive capability of the model was evaluated in terms of mean absolute percentage error between the model fitted and actual plant data, while sensitivity analysis was performed on the input parameters by determining the absolute average sensitivity values. The higher absolute average sensitivity value of the incinerator exit temperature in comparison to that of feed water pressure, feed water temperature and conveyor speed suggested that the change of incineration exit temperature has a significant influence on the selected outputs (steam properties). Overall, the good results observed from this work demonstrate the fact that artificial neural networks can efficiently predict the data on steam properties and could serve as a good tool to monitor boiler behavior under real-time conditions.

However, emergence of motifs in growing networks may be problematic due to large fluctuation of subgraph frequency in the initial stage. This paper contributes to present a method which can identify the emergence of motif in growing networks. Based on the Erdos-Renyi(E-R) random null model, the variation rate of expected frequency of subgraph at adjacent time points was used to define the suitable detection range for motif identification. Upper and lower boundaries of the range were obtained in analytical form according to a chosen risk level. Then, the statistical metric Z-score was extended to a new one, Z(continuous), which effectively reveals the statistical significance of subgraph in a continuous period of time. In this paper, a novel research framework of motif identification was proposed, defining critical boundaries for the evolutionary process of networks and a significance metric of time scale. Finally, an industrial ecosystem at Kalundborg was adopted as a case study to illustrate the effectiveness and convenience of the proposed methodology.},

This paper describes a novel architecture utilizing concepts of autonomic computing and a simple object access protocol (SOAP)-based interface to metadata access points (IF-MAP) external communication layer to create a network security sensor. This approach simplifies integration of legacy software and supports a secure, scalable, and self-managed framework. The contribution of this paper is twofold: 1) A flexible two-level communication layer based on autonomic computing and service oriented architecture is detailed and 2) three complementary modules that dynamically reconfigure in response to a changing environment are presented. One module utilizes clustering and fuzzy logic to monitor traffic for abnormal behavior. Another module passively monitors network traffic and deploys deceptive virtual network hosts. These components of the sensor system were implemented in C++ and PERL and utilize a common internal D-Bus communication mechanism. A proof of concept prototype was deployed on a mixed-use test network showing the possible real-world applicability. In testing, 45 of the 46 network attached devices were recognized and 10 of the 12 emulated devices were created with specific operating system and port configurations. In addition, the anomaly detection algorithm achieved a 99.9\% recognition rate. All output from the modules were correctly distributed using the common communication structure.},

In the UK, municipal responses to Local Agenda 21 after 1992 depended on whether or not councils were fully committed. As new national priorities emerged, the broad cross-sectoral participation in Local Agenda 21 was lost. New strategies had less outreach to the community. The UK Eco-town programme looked to be ambitious when it was announced, but financial constraints and political changes have led it to become a small scale Eco-community programme of more energy-efficient housing but with few of the originally broad ecological and sustainability goals.

	abstract = {Thermal membrane distillation (TMD) is an emerging technology which is gaining an increasing level of interest in the area of high-purity separation especially in water treatment. It is driven primarily by heat which creates a vapor-pressure difference across a porous hydrophobic membrane. The integration of TMD with industrial processes offers several advantages. Excess low-level heat from the process can be used to drive TMD. This transfer of heat also reduces the cooling utility load for the process. Therefore, dual heat-reduction benefits accrue as a result of this heat integration. Additionally, process wastewater and utility water may be treated using TMD then recycle or reused in the process or sold to external users. This paper introduces a process integration framework from the thermal coupling of TMD networks and industrial processes. First, a three-parameter model is developed to quantify the water flux through the membranes as a function of heat and temperature. The model is validated using experimental data for direct-contact membrane distillation (DCMD). Next, the trans-shipment model for heat integration is extended to account for the coupling of the process and the TMD network and the need to optimize the extent of heating for the TMD feed. A discretization approach is used to linearize the thermal-coupling constraints. The mathematical-programming formulation is solved to identify the optimal heat integration strategies within the process and with the TMD network. The program also determines the optimal temperature to which the TMD feed should be heated and the system design and specification. A case study is solved to show the integration between a gas-to-methanol process and an adjacent desalination process. Three scenarios are considered: a standalone TMD network, TMD with thermal and water coupling with a process in an eco-industrial park setting, and TMD as part of the processing facility.},

Our findings affirm and extend the literature in a number of ways. In particular, we found that a firm's number of identified waste streams decreased the likelihood of initiating an exchange, but increased the likelihood of completing it once initiated. We also found, counter to the literature, that diversity among partnering firms reduced the likelihood of both initiating and completing an IS exchange. Finally, we found that higher economic value exchanges were more likely to be initiated, but less likely to be completed. We discuss implications and conclude with a number of avenues for future research.},

The research revolved around the concept of IS, the assessment of eco-industrial park projects, and the establishment of waste treatment and recycling networks. In the second period (2006-2012), diverse research approaches and theories enriched the field, which has led to a maturation in theory building. Our findings clearly illustrate that IS evolved from practice-oriented research toward coherent theory building through a systematic underpinning and linking of diverse topics. As scientific attention shifted from exploring a phenomenon to elucidating underlying mechanisms, IS knowledge found worldwide practical implementation. The coauthorship network shows that the academic communities of IS are distributed worldwide and that international collaboration is widespread. Through bibliometric and network analysis of IS, we have created a systemic, quantitative image of the evolution of the IS research field and community, which gives IS researchers an underpinned overview of the IS research and may help them to identify new directions and synergy in worldwide research.},

And whether the CER collaborations could improve the performance of participants is another focus of our study. This paper provides a questionnaire survey about CER inter-firm collaborations on energy intensive industries in China. Three regression models including Multiple Linear Regression, Binary Choice Model, and Ordinal Choice Regression are employed to identify the determinants that drive or impede the implementation of CER collaborations. The results show that inter-firm CER collaborations are generally at an infancy stage in China. The main driver for CER collaborations derives from the CER demands of other stakeholders in the industrial chains. And the lack of infrastructure and mechanism is the main barrier that impedes the inter-firm collaborations. Moreover, CER collaborations through industrial symbiosis play a positive role in improving economic performance. However, the effects are to a large extent related to the improved environmental performance through the CER collaborations. Our results also indicate that there is much room for industrial firms to conduct CER collaborations in China, and market tools are somewhat more effective than compulsive regulations for promoting CER collaborations.

However, the low-carbon performance of eco-industrial parks is unverified. In this study, a comprehensive greenhouse gas emissions inventory for industrial parks was established, including three sectors: energy consumption, industrial processes and product use, and waste. The Beijing Economic Technological Development Area (BDA), a typical national eco-industrial park of China, was chosen for a case study. The results show that the total greenhouse gas emissions of the eco-industrial park were 3.16 Mt CO(2)e in 2010, and energy-related greenhouse gas emissions accounted for 97\% of the total. The greenhouse gas emissions increased by 94\% from 2005 to 2010. However, the greenhouse gas emissions intensity decreased by 20\%, mainly due to optimization of the energy structure and improvements in energy efficiency. The share of non-industrial sectors in the total greenhouse gas emissions increased from 12\% to 33\%, and the construction industry became the second biggest emissions source, after manufacturing. Scenario analysis indicates that greenhouse gas emissions in the eco-industrial park could be lower than the 2010 levels as eco-industrial development proceeds, but more efforts are needed to improve energy and material efficiency. The case study has great implications for low-carbon development in other industrial parks. It is vital to build the low-carbon economy by implementing policies that will expand eco-industrial park practice and promote low-carbon development in more than 1500 industrial parks in China.

To reverse these trends, the United States can transition to an infinitely reusable, recyclable, and renewable industrial ecosystem (IR3). The concept requires new classes of infinitely reusable materials based on advanced carbon technologies; increased recycling of standard materials such as glass and plastic; and substitution of renewable materials for non-renewable virgin materials. In combination with new emphases within our energy system, implementing the IR3 ecosystem could reduce United States carbon dioxide emissions from the industrial sector by more than 80\% by 2050.

	abstract = {The production of food waste covers all the food life cycle: from agriculture, up to industrial manufacturing and processing, retail and household consumption. In developed countries, 42\% of food waste is produced by households, while 39\% losses occur in the food manufacturing industry, 14\% in food service sector and remaining 5\% in retail and distribution. Increasingly, industrial ecology concepts such as cradle to cradle and circular economy are considered leading principle for eco-innovation, aiming at “zero waste economy” in which waste are used as raw material for new products and applications. The large amount of waste produced by the food industry, in addition to being a great loss of valuable materials, also raises serious management problems, both from the economic and environmental point of view. Many of these residues, however, have the potential to be reused into other production systems, trough e.g. biorefineries. The present work focuses on the use of food waste coming from food manufacturing (FWm). Through extensive literature review, the authors present feasibility and constraints of applying industrial symbiosis in recovering waste from food processing, focusing on recycling (excluding energy recovery) of the solid and liquid waste from food processing industry. The main uses of functional ingredients derived from this transformation are presented and discussed, highlighting mainstream sectors of application, e.g. in the nutraceutical and pharmaceutical industry.

	abstract = {The study of industrial symbiosis (IS) has largely focused on the exchange of energy and materials among industrial processes in an effort to increase value and reduce environmental impact. Agricultural systems, particularly those located in developing countries, can benefit from the principles of IS. Relatively few studies have analyzed the potential benefits of integrated material and energy flows in smallholder farming, even though these systems are considered essential to the world's food supply and poverty reduction. Although the concepts can be applied to virtually any system, the study of industrial symbiosis has traditionally focused on industrialized systems in developed countries. The research presented here applies the principles of IS to smallholder farms using optimization techniques to maximize farm output while minimizing wastes. Our research links IS to the growing field of integrated farming research (IFR), which seeks to create new technologies that increase the production of farms by viewing the farm as a system. Bridging these fields enriches the potential for robust research outcomes in both areas and fills a current knowledge gap. IS benefits from exploring new applications and increasing its penetration into the developing world. IFR benefits from established IS tools to create alternate pathways for increased output based on symbiotic relationships. A small farming system in Liberia, West Africa, is used as a case study. System integration of individual unit processes shows increased productivity and decreased waste. The results of this analysis indicate that there are unrealized opportunities for IS in developing countries, and integration of IS techniques into smallholder farming operations has the potential for impacting sustainable development.},

This way, the proposed superstructure allows proper heat integration to reduce the use of external cooling and heating utilities as well as the consumption of external electric energy. The proposed superstructure is modeled through a mathematical programming formulation where the objective function considers the simultaneous minimization of the operating and capital costs for the units involved in the system as well the possible revenues from the sales of electricity. The model is formulated in such a way that avoids numerical complications during its solution. Results from the application of the proposed approach show that the interplant-integration offers significant savings compared to the traditional single-plant integration with and without considering ORCs.

Experimental data confirmed the structure of the nanocomposite. There was an efficient energy transfer between the excitation source and the probe, which made the nanocomposite a promising sensing system. The spectral response towards Hg(II) suggested that the fluorescence intensity of the nanocomposite increased with the increasing Hg(II) concentration, showing “off-on” effect.

	abstract = {Multimodal urban transportation systems exhibit complex interactions between components, including users, multimodal transportation facilities, supply side agencies, and operators. Although these interactions are obvious, rigorous quantitative methods for optimizing control variables across modes of transportation on real-world networks are deficient. A social welfare maximization model was established for joint optimization of bus fare, rail transit fare, and congestion tolls for private cars. The authors determined the optimality conditions and the second-order partial derivatives for this optimization problem. Because of the complexity of the multimodal urban transportation system, the objective function of social welfare has no closed form and is extremely expensive to evaluate. The authors therefore proposed a simulation-based framework for evaluation of the objective function and optimization of three decision variables across multiple travel modes. Several metamodels (i.e., mathematical functions that approximate the true shape of an unknown, nonlinear, and complex objective function) were adopted to approximate the highly nonlinear input-output mappings in the urban system. This is the first study to develop a simulation-based method for joint optimization of transit and road network operations. The case study applied the simulation-based optimization framework to the Sino-Singapore ecocity in Tianjin, China, by using VISSUM as the urban systems simulator. An “ecocity” is defined by the authors as “a thriving city that is socially harmonious, environmentally friendly, resource-efficient, and a model for sustainable development.” Results show that metamodels can accurately approximate the real objective function and produce good suboptimal and near-optimal solutions. The optimal combination of transit fares and congestion tolls significantly outperform those under two baseline scenarios. The optimal solutions also suggest that extreme transit fares (too high or too low) or congestion tolls are contrary to welfare-maximizing objectives. The proposed method can be applied for joint optimization of other multimodal planning and operational strategies, such as investment and operational decisions across various modes of transportation.},

We critically analyze the eco-town initiative's policy evolution and early planning phase from a multilevel governance perspective by focusing on the following two interrelated aspects: (1) the evolving governance structures and resulting dynamics arising from the development of the eco-town initiative at UK governmental level, and the subsequent partial devolution to local stakeholders, including local authorities and nongovernmental actors, under the new `localism' agenda; and (2) the effect of these governance dynamics on the conceptual and practical approach to adaptation through the emerging eco-town projects. As such, we problematize the impact of multilevel governance relations, and competing governance strategies and leadership, on shaping eco-town and related adaptation strategies and practice.},

First, an assessment of the total EIP emissions' inventory and impacts is conducted; the second step, focusing on the sustainability benefits of combined heating and power (CHP) plants and photovoltaic technologies, developed a multi-objective mathematical model including both economic and environmental objectives in a Pareto-frontier optimisation analysis. Four different scenarios involving combinations of CHP plants (internal combustion engine, gas turbine, micro-turbines and fuel cells) and two types of PV plant (monocrystalline and polycrystalline) were evaluated. The third step utilises a MADM methodology - the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) - for selecting the best alternative among the Pareto-frontier efficient solutions.

Based on our analysis, competition helps certain types of parks become self-organized such that constituent firms spontaneously improve their eco-design. If eco-design is not improved in a park due to the existing competition and production conditions, an ordinary tax-subsidy should be sufficient to make the parks self-organized.

By substantially eliminating evaporation of water, reductions in downstream energy consumption from 65\% to 73\% were achieved while generating hydrochar, fatty acids, treated process water, and biogas co-products providing new opportunities for the industry. Processing whole stillage in this manner produced the four co-products, eliminated centrifugation and evaporation, and substantially reduced drying. With thin stillage, all four co-products were again produced, as well as a high quality animal feed. Anaerobic digestion of the aqueous product stream from the hydrothermal carbonization of thin stillage reduced chemical oxygen demand (COD) by more than 90\% and converted 83\% of the initial COD to methane.

To this end, a novel methodology based on life cycle assessment (LCA) has been developed in this study, with the aim of quantifying, in terms of CO2 emissions equivalent, the impact associated with different alternatives of waste collection systems in different urban typologies. This new approach is focussed on saving energy and raw materials and reducing the environmental impact associated with the waste collection system in urban areas, as well as allowing the design and planning of the best available technologies and most environment-friendly management. The methodology considers a large variety of variables from the point of view of sustainable urban transport such as the location and size of the urban area, the amount of solid waste generated, the level of social awareness on waste separation procedures, the distance between houses and waste collection points and the distance from the latter to the possible recovery plants and/or landfills, taking into account the material and Energy recovery ratio within an integrated waste management system. As a case study, two different waste collection systems have been evaluated with this methodology in the ecocity Valdespartera located in Zaragoza, Spain, consisting of approximately 10,000 homes: (i) a system based on traditional truck transportation and manual collection, and (ii) a stationary vacuum waste collection system. Results show that, when operating at loads close to 100\%, the stationary collection system has the best environmental performance in comparison with the conventional system. In contrast, when operating at load factors around 13\% the environmental benefits in terms of net CO2-eq. emissions for the stationary collection system are around 60\% lower in comparison with the conventional one.

The framework is underpinned by complex adaptive systems theory, industrial ecology, and an analysis of the experiences of existing EIPs. The proposed framework draws on the observed strengths of two types of industrial symbiosis modelsplanned eco-industrial parks (PEIPs) and EIPs that developed through self-organizing symbiosis (SOS)as well as their observed weaknesses and the features of complex adaptive systems. From this analysis, five key properties to be modeled are deduced: functionality, reliability, life span, theoretical knowledge, and adaptability. It is proposed that the properties of functionality and theoretical knowledge are determined by the goals of the EIP and its member companies, while the property of adaptability is determined by the understanding that the companies in an EIP have of the environment surrounding the EIP, while the properties of reliability and life span are determined by the internal and external relationships of the companies that make up an EIP.},

This paper highlights the advantages of this arrangement using life cycle assessment to determine the energy and environmental costs and benefits of the existing pattern of exchanges. A consequential approach was used to evaluate each material substitution for four environmental impact categories: primary energy use, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, acidification, and eutrophication. Each material exchange included avoided production and reduced use of virgin materials, any necessary pre-processing or transportation of local by-products, and avoided treatment or disposal of these by-products. All exchanges exhibited positive net savings across all environmental impact categories, with the exceptions of waste oil and tire-derived fuel burned as substitutes for coal. The greatest savings occur as a result of sharing steam between a combined cycle fuel oil-fired cogeneration plant and a nearby refinery. In total, the environmental savings realized by this industrial cluster are significant, equivalent to 25 \% of the state's policy goal for reducing the industrial component of GHG emissions over the next decade. The role of policy in supporting material and energy exchanges is also discussed as the central cluster of two power plants and two refineries share steam and water in part under regulatory requirements. The results show environmental benefits of the sharing of by-product resources accrued on a life cycle basis, while for the local context, the reduction of imported fuels and materials helps to reduce the external dependency of Oahu's remote island economy. The environmental benefits of materials exchanges are often ignored in energy policy, though, as in this case, they can represent considerable savings.},

	abstract = {One of the assumptions underlying much of the research on Industrial Symbiosis (IS) that has been performed over the past decades is that besides technical and economic feasibility collaboration between firms is of central importance to the development of IS. So far, there has been little systematic research into the process through which firms and other relevant actors build up collaborations for IS. I present Event Sequence Analysis as a research approach that allows for a systematic, longitudinal analysis of process phenomena and I outline the steps to be taken in the application of the approach. I demonstrate the value of the approach by offering a first analysis of how companies in the Canal Zone of Zeeland in the Netherlands build up the institutional capacity that enables them to address the development of IS collaboratively. The analysis reveals that institutional capacity did not build up in a linear way. The generation of institutional capacity enabled the involved actors to engage in increasingly complex by-product synergies and utility synergies. It also enabled the actors to develop a strategic vision in which they articulated the development of a bio based industrial cluster as a common purpose. This common purpose stimulated the actors to shift their focus from the development of individual synergies to the development of a regional network of such synergies. Event Sequence Analysis proves to be a promising approach to investigating phenomena such as institutional capacity building and the emergence and development of Industrial Symbiosis.

Processes that convert palm-based biomass (e.g., empty fruit bunches, palm oil mill effluent, etc.) into value added products via single conversion technology (i.e., thermal, biological, and physical conversion technologies) are well established. However, integrating multiple conversion technologies to convert palm-based biomasses into value-added palm green products (e.g., biofuels, biochemicals) has not been studied. In this work, a conceptual zone of integrated palm oil processing complex (POPC) that is owned by single owner is introduced to fully utilize palm-based biomasses for value-added palm green product production and heat and power generation. In this work, integrated POPC is defined as a complex that integrates palm oil mill (POM), palm oil refinery (POR), palm oil-based biorefinery (POB), and combined heat power (CHP) at the same site. A systematic generic approach for synthesis and optimization of integrated POPC to achieve maximum economic performance is developed and presented in Part 1 of this series. The optimized network configuration that achieves the targets can also be determined. Meanwhile, the synthesis and optimization of integrated POPC that has multiple owners of those processing facilities is further analyzed based on industrial symbiosis concept and will be presented in Part 2 of this series.},

The European operational environment and national environmental steering in EU member states highlight the importance of sustainable development and the development of associated new management approaches to promote sustainability. This article reviews some key elements of sustainability management, covering examples of both Finnish forest products industry initiatives and public environmental steering at the European level. An assessment is made of the current situation and an outline of a future outlook for sustainability management, with special emphasis on bridging the gap between industry initiatives and environmental steering in the form of legislation, policies and strategies at the EU level. This study applied a hybrid approach comprising a review of EU sustainability initiatives, a policy and legal review and a questionnaire survey of forest industry actors. The results of the future outlook indicate that energy efficiency is perceived to be the most important focus area in addition to e.g. environmental and waste management and recycling. Less than half of the companies aim at applying sustainability management. Life-cycle management is also considered to be important whereas product-based approaches, climate change and local industrial symbiosis receive very little attention. All responding companies aim to integrate the principles of sustainability into their operations and most companies consider that life-cycle thinking, management and assessment are useful for them. Energy efficiency is identified as the most important focus area with energy and materials efficiency seen as the most crucial factors for the achievement of responsible competitive advantage and building of sustainable value-added. The findings indicate that sustainability and life-cycle management are not receiving enough management focus at the moment and neither is the industry receiving enough guidance at either the EU level or via national steering and regulatory frameworks.

	abstract = {This article argues that recent proposals for environmental and evolutionary economic geographies (EEG 1 and EEG2) should be integrated; EEG2 is used as passing convenience to make this case. EEG1's emphasis on environmental imperatives is loosely framed and needs a theoretical socio-economic evolutionary base that is the central thrust of EEG2. Meanwhile EEG2 would be empowered by incorporating environmental concerns within its mandate. Moreover, both EEG1 and EEG2 share common roots in institutional methodologies, emphasize cumulative causation and path-dependent behaviour, have strong interests at regional scales of analysis, and both are intimately tied to the causes and consequences of innovation. This article provides a rationale and suggests an integrative conceptual approach for developing EEG2. In particular, the article outlines a conceptual framework that interprets EEG2 in terms of co-evolutionary socio-ecological and multi-scalar processes that are situated within a reasoned history interpretation of economic development. This framework further highlights the roles of path dependency, innovation, multinational corporations and value chains. How this multi-scalar framework may be elaborated is then discussed around three themes: extending placed-based analysis of localized clusters; broadening the scope of global value chain analysis; and re-engaging the analysis of core-periphery relations. Ultimately the case for EEG2 is to ensure that economic geographic perspectives are fully incorporated in debates over the co-evolution of economy and environment, in research and policy terms one of, if not the, central challenges of development in the 21st century.},

	abstract = {The sustainable utilisation of natural resources requires a new focus on optimal material cycles and material efficiency. Recycling and sustainable industrial development through improved process design are therefore key in this context. In this study, we assessed the potential barriers within the Finnish legal framework regarding the development of novel residue-based industrial symbiosis products. A review is also made of the UK based Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) and Finnish MOTIVA initiatives both of which aim at promoting sustainable and efficient use of materials focussing on the examination of End of Waste (EoW) approaches and quality protocols that guide residue recovery. The research approach was based on both legal review and analysis of relevant policy instruments. The research material includes interviews of actors in both operations and environmental management in various process industry companies in Finland. An industrial symbiosis case study is presented based on previous research and close collaboration between the metals and forest products process industry. The main research question is “does EU policy and the legal framework at the national level create barriers to the development of innovative residue based symbiosis products despite the fact that achievement of the stated goals of `recycling society' and `sustainable industry' require sustainable use of natural resources and high level of material efficiency such as enhanced waste utilisation and prevention?” The results suggest that an innovative approach to environmental permitting and a comprehensive approach to recycling, encompassing new quality and environmental compliance criteria for certain recycled materials, should receive more focus in future decision-making. Material and energy efficiency, as well as life-cycle and systems thinking are all found to be essential elements of this new approach to inter-industrial residues streams. We find that the institutional status of one of our case study products in particular (a fertiliser product, based on multiple residue stream derived raw materials), should be clarified. This paper focuses on Finnish domestic framework issues. It is continuation of the article Watkins et al.

This approach provided insights into details of the network's interior and analyzed the overall degree of connectedness and the relationships among the nodes within the network. We then characterized the structural attributes of the network and subnetwork nodes at two levels (core and periphery), thereby providing insights into the operational problems within each eco-industrial park. We chose ten typical ecoindustrial parks in China and around the world and compared the degree of network connectedness of these systems that resulted from exchanges of products, byproducts, and wastes. By analyzing the density and nodal degree, we determined the relative power and status of the nodes in these networks, as well as other structural attributes such as the core-periphery structure and the degree of sub-network connectedness. The results reveal the operational problems created by the structure of the industrial networks and provide a basis for improving the degree of completeness, thereby increasing their potential for sustainable development and enriching the methods available for the study of industrial symbiosis.},

	abstract = {Background: Assessing neighborhood vitality is important to understanding how to improve quality of life and health outcomes. The ecocity model recognizes that cities are part of natural systems and favors walkable neighborhoods. This article introduces ecocity mapping, an innovative planning method, to the public health literature on community engagement by describing a pilot project with a new affordable housing development in Oakland, California between 2007 and 2009. Although ecocity mapping began as a paper technology, advances in geographic information systems (GIS) moved it forward. Objectives: This article describes how Ecocity Builders used GIS to conduct ecocity mapping to (1) assess vitality of neighborhoods and urban centers to prioritize community health intervention pilot sites and (2) create scenario maps for use in community health planning. Methods: From fall 2007 to summer 2008, Ecocity Builders assessed neighborhood vitality using walking distance from parks, schools, rapid transit stops, grocery stores, and retail outlets. In 2008, ecocity maps were shared with residents to create a neighborhood health and sustainability plan. In 2009, Ecocity Builders developed scenario maps to show how changes to the built environment would improve air quality by reducing greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, while increasing access to basic services and natural amenities. Conclusions: Community organizing with GIS was more useful than GIS alone for final site selection. GIS was useful in mapping scenarios after residents shared local neighborhood knowledge and ideas for change. Residents were interested in long-term environmental planning, provided they could meet immediate needs.},

The methodology has three stages. First, we outline the problem setting on the basis of the stakeholders' mental model analysis. Second, more specific research problems and proposed solutions are formulated collaboratively with researchers from different fields. Third, the hypotheses are tested and challenged in a workshop with the interviewed stakeholders and re-formulated into final institutional recommendations.

	abstract = {The development of novel symbiosis products based on primary industrial residues in accordance with the systemic approaches of Industrial Ecology (IE) and Industrial Symbiosis (IS) has significant potential to increase the environmental performance of process industry, including more material and energy efficient processes and with lower environmental impacts. What is more, functionally innovative symbiosis products have the potential to promote residue utilisation and recovery and to prevent or reduce waste generation in line with the EU level `recycling society' concept. However, successful product development requires an enabling institutionally aligned environmental approach that includes appropriate market incentives and regulatory instruments. This paper aims to identify the possible institutional barriers in the EU legal framework that have to be addressed to promote the development of such primary residue based process industry symbiosis products, with thorough consideration of full product life-cycles. Recommendations for overcoming these barriers and on the design of new approaches that support industrial symbiosis and contribute to progress towards sustainable societies are also outlined. These include enhanced focus on creating an enabling institutional environment for industrial innovations and the promotion of material efficiency through incentives policies and regulations, as well as soft law guidance on novel uses of materials and closure of resource cycles. Making a wider system more sustainable on an eco-efficiency basis also calls the definition of system boundaries into question. Applying a systemic approach, such as that offered by both IE and IS, which cover sustainability and recycling to achieve more resource efficient systems, appears to offer a way forward. We argue that the development of process industry residue based products can be significantly promoted and advanced by co-operative and joint design of appropriate incentives, policies and regulations. A major question is whether the REACH Regulation would apply to residue, based symbiosis products if their creation makes them no longer legally classified as waste under end-of-waste legislation. We use a synthetic symbiosis product group concept based on the utilisation of steel, paper and pulp process industry primary residues as a case study to assess the development potential of such products against legal requirements and policy objectives.

	abstract = {Due to increasing energy scarcity and environmental issues as well as the goal to develop low carbon society, the Chinese government initiated a comprehensive Energy Saving and Emission Reduction (ESER) program for sustainable production and consumption in 2005. Under the ESER program, Chinese manufacturers have struggled to reduce their environmental pollution and energy consumption. To achieve their ESER goals, Chinese manufacturers should cooperate with their suppliers and customers. However, it is not clear how to drive Chinese manufacturers to implement extended supply chain (ESC) practices for ESER goals, and what kinds of barriers exist. By utilizing a total of 299 usable questionnaires, we did descriptive analysis. Statistic results show that Chinese manufacturers implement ESC practices for ESER goals at a low level. Coercive, normative and mimetic drivers are generally weak while internal barriers are relatively higher. We further used hierarchical analysis to examine whether drivers motivate Chinese manufacturers to implement ESC practices for ESER goals, and whether barriers impede ESC practices. Main regression results and implications include: (1) Coercive drivers do not really motivate ESC practices for ESER goals. To promote ESC practices for the ESER goals, the Chinese government should enact stricter regulations and strengthen their enforcement level. (2) Normative drivers motivate Chinese manufacturers to implement sustainable purchasing. With the increasing environmental awareness of Chinese consumers, Chinese manufactures will have higher normative drivers and then be more proactive to implement sustainable purchasing. (3) Mimetic drivers promote both sustainable purchasing and sustainable customer cooperation. By learning from manufacturers in developed countries, especially those operating in China, Chinese manufacturers tend to implement ESC practice for ESER goals. (4) Internal barriers, such as lack of financial gains, resource and capability, are main obstacles for the implementation of sustainable customer cooperation. Thus, how to overcome internal barriers is a key for Chinese manufacturers to effectively and efficiently implement ESC practices for ESER goals. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Industry encouraged by financial penalties from the Government faces the challenges of cleaner and more sustainable production whilst trying to remain competitive in the market place. This paper proposes “Fit Thinking” as a means by which waste can be reduced from the early design stages, alongside the “All Seeing Eye of Business” - a model to illustrate potential sources of profit and loss in a manufacturing firm's output. A literature review on waste and profitability reveals the basis for the model. Concepts from material flow cost accounting, the Kanthal effect, and the Kano model are combined, together with industry case studies, to develop the model. The model is explained in detail, demonstrating twelve types of relationships between a company's product outputs and the profitability of each output. The model and the relationships it proposes are then tested against examples from literature. Ultimately, Fit Thinking is shown to help companies prevent waste; where waste is unavoidable, the All Seeing Eye of Business model can be used by companies in the understanding of their non-product output (waste), providing insights into the nature of their waste and the impact on profitability. It is hoped that this understanding will encourage them to see waste as a potential profit-making “co-product”, rather than as a necessary evil. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

It is defined as a relationship between two or more firms that exchange their waste (materials - energy - water), as feedstock for the production process. The companies that have such a relationship form an Industrial Ecosystem. Industrial Ecosystems are divided into two categories: Eco-Industrial Parks and Eco-Industrial Networks. However, research conducted in recent years shows that the recycling of certain waste products through multilevel Eco-Industrial Networks has potential physical, spatial, economic and environmental conditions and limits that restrict its potential applications.

Specifically, as shown by this case study of an Aluminium Eco-Industrial Network, there may exist a marginal Network Level (environmental limit) beyond which it is environmentally preferable to avoid recycling of some waste types, to simply their use as fuels, or to dispose them directly to the natural environment as-is, rather than to attempt to recover useful materials from them.},

The spatial scale of waste exchange includes the following levels: Industrial Park (IP), Local (LOC), Regional (REG), National (NAT) and Global (GLO). The paper concludes that industrial symbiosis does indeed have spatial conditions and limits that restrict its potential applications. Specifically, the spatial scale at which Eco-Industrial Networks are developed, in addition to the “general” spatial-economic, spatial-social, and environmental factors that affect the location of industry, is also influenced by several “specific” factors. Therefore, the development of an Eco-Industrial Network on a specific spatial scale, for example regional, is possible only when considering these factors. The same applies to the case of development of an Eco-Industrial Network at the lowest level of spatial scale, namely the development of an Eco-Industrial Park.},

	abstract = {Amorphous silicon (a-Si:H)-based solar cells have the lowest ecological impact of photovoltaic (PV) materials. In order to continue to improve the environmental performance of PV manufacturing using proposed industrial symbiosis techniques, this paper performs a life cycle analysis (LCA) on both conventional 1-GW scaled a-Si:H-based single junction and a-Si:H/microcrystalline-Si:H tandem cell solar PV manufacturing plants and such plants coupled to silane recycling plants. Both the energy consumed and greenhouse gas emissions are tracked in the LCA, then silane gas is reused in the manufacturing process rather than standard waste combustion. Using a recycling process that results in a silane loss of only 17\% instead of conventional processing that loses 85\% silane, results in an energy savings of 81,700 GJ and prevents 4400 tons of CO2 from being released into the atmosphere per year for the single junction plant. Due to the increased use of silane for the relatively thick microcrystalline-Si:H layers in the tandem junction plants, the savings are even more substantial - 290,000 GJ of energy savings and 15.6 million kg of CO2 eq. emission reductions per year. This recycling process reduces the cost of raw silane by 68\%, or approximately \$22.6 million per year for a 1-GW a-Si:H-based PV production facility and over \$79 million per year for tandem manufacturing. The results are discussed and conclusions are drawn about the technical feasibility and environmental benefits of silane recycling in an eco-industrial park centered around a-Si:H-based PV manufacturing plants.

The Chinese government attaches great importance to the marine industry and made it the focal point of China economy in the 12th five-year plan. Water is an important material for the marine chemical industry, but wastewater discharge could undermine the sustainable development of the marine chemical industry. Industrial ecology provides insights for industry to realize a harmonious development with the environment. This paper examined the case of water utilization practice based on industrial ecology of the Hai Hua Group (HHG) in China. The utilization of three kinds of water, i.e., underground brine, seawater and freshwater is characteristic of the industrial ecology implementation of the HHG. In this paper, the water utilization practice of the HHG was described. The relationships among the three kinds of water, the driving force of water utilization, and the challenges of water utilization in the HHG were discussed. We conclude that implementing industrial ecology is a promising choice for the water utilization of marine chemical industry. It could also achieve the coordinated development between sea farming and the marine chemical industry. For non-renewable resource driven regional industrial ecosystems, such as the Hai Hua industrial ecosystem (HHIE) in this paper, seeking a substitute approach is essential for the stable and sustainable development of the whole industrial ecosystem. We also conclude that an industrial ecosystem's operation is driven by the integration of many factors, such as government, market, policy, culture and technique in this paper. This requires us to examine an industrial ecosystem's operation from a wider perspective, which is helpful to comprehensively and systematically understand the impetus of an industrial ecosystem.

	abstract = {This paper outlines the emergence of eco-cities in Japan from a much needed historical perspective. Since Japan's rapid industrialization in the late nineteenth century, there has been an emphasis on economic growth at all costs. Despite the introduction of the concept of the Garden City in Japan in the early twentieth century, industrialization continued unabated. After a disastrous World War II, the nation rebuilt and enjoyed rapid economic growth in the 1950s and 1960s. Japan is still coming to terms with the cost of that economic growth. The paper examines three cities: Minamata, Kitakyushu, and Kawasaki. Minamata has transformed itself from being a polluted city to a green tourism destination. The city of Kitakyushu embraced an eco-town strategy in 1997 to promote a structural shift away from heavy industries to green industries. That year, Kawasaki (close to the Tokyo Metropolitan area), too, was designated an eco-town and Minamata received the same title in 2001. This paper identifies key features of eco-cities/eco-towns in Japan, the importance of retrofitting, and examines the roles of citizens, the government, and the private sector. What is surprising is the international orientation of Japanese eco-cities. These cities represent not only Japan's future, but also its efforts to deal with its industrial past.},

When thermal energy is exchanged between buildings and the district, the second law of thermodynamics becomes a key issue. This study discusses the importance of exergy in evaluating and rating district energy (DE) systems towards a greener status and proposes a circular exergy model that may carry the net-zero concept to net-zero energy and net-zero exergy cities. This paper presents an optimum DE system design tool based on compound CO2 emissions metrication algorithm. Sample results indicate that net-zero energy building concepts may indeed be elevated to a city level if both energy and exergy are simultaneously taken into account in a circular exergy format.

The firm creates value through this process innovation and can capture this value by capturing newly created market opportunities, taking market share from competitors, or licensing the innovation to its competitors. We determine the optimal operating and licensing strategies for the firm and find market conditions under which the firm would benefit most from. implementing BPS. We show that the optimal operating and licensing strategies are driven by the size of the cost reduction enabled by the BPS process innovation. We also show that leveraging the synergies between the original product and by-product can lead to counterintuitive profit-maximizing operating strategies such as increasing the amount of waste generated, and strategically increasing the quantity of original product above the business as usual production volume.

The strategy is applied and validated in a system where the producers are the Galician (NW Spain) printing plants belonging to a regional association, and represented by a reference plant. The intermediate waste manager is a local waste transfer station. The strategy considers the waste management hierarchy, settled by the European waste Directive, and the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) philosophy. Both elements are combined, and the IPPC philosophy is adapted to the small and medium sized enterprises. The original system, integrated by a printing plant and a waste transfer station, is analysed to detect the Improvable Flows. A series of alternatives, based on the waste management hierarchy and on Best Available Techniques, are proposed to improve the system, and some of them are selected for being implemented. After implementation, the improved system is compared with the original one, showing that, besides reducing the amount of waste managed in the system, a symbiotic relationship between both actors has been settled. In this work, principles established considering big installations have been adapted to sectors that, in spite of being mainly integrated by small and medium-sized enterprises, generate a not negligible amount of diverse hazardous wastes.

Thermal pinch analysis is commonly used for a systematic matching of process streams and thus planning of optimal process integration in large chemical plants. The possible savings increase with the amount of heat and the number of integrated process streams. Therefore co- siting of several companies in a symbiotic network opens new opportunities for process integration even in small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs), but also introduces new challenges. Thermal pinch analysis is extended here to account for piping distances and fluctuations and limited availability of energy flows by adding additional costs for the piping system and a backup utility system in the optimization function. Cooperative game theory is proposed to derive a sharing of savings between the partners of the industrial symbiosis that is optimal for each partner and should prevent partners from leaving the network because of higher benefits in a subgroup or alone. It is argued that knowledge about the optimality of a network for each partner creates trust between the partners that is a necessary base for the long-term commitment needed in industrial symbioses. An exemplary symbiotic network combining the production of pulp and woody biomass energy carriers is used to illustrate the proposed approaches.},

	abstract = {An energy-focused environmental accounting method based on the embodied solar energy (emergy) principle was used for evaluating biomass and coal-based combined heat and power (CHP) cogeneration processes. The emergy method expresses all the resources needed (fuel, investment, labor etc.) as solar energy equivalents. The method looks at sustainability from the point of view of the biosphere. In fact, emergy aims to be a `memory' of how much work the biosphere has done to provide a product. Biomass and coal-based CHP alternatives were compared with independent production of heat \& power. It was found that biomass-based cogeneration is 3.3 times more emergy-efficient than coal-based independent production; i.e. the biosphere needed to work 77\% less for biomass CHP produced heat \& power compared to that produced independently from coal. Cogeneration from the same fuel was in all cases 0.3 times more emergy-efficient than independent production. In general heat and power production from biomass is 2.3 times more emergy-efficient than that from coal in a similar process. The emergy sustainability index shows a similar trend, e.g. the sustainability index of a biomass CHP plant is 15 times higher than that of a coal CHP plant. The fuel, its transport, and the oxygen in air used for burning account for over 80\% of the emergy in biomass CHP whereas in a coal-based process the share is over 90\%. The share of capital is quite small in terms of total emergy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Industrial Ecology (IE) is considered a recent but very promising research field; it offers new perspectives of solutions to environmental problems related to production that combines the aim of sustainability, both global and local, with the competitiveness of companies. The application of IE principles at the local level lead to the development of Eco-Industrial Parks (EIPs). An EIP can arise spontaneously, by the initiative of companies, or be guided by local government; it can result in the creation of a new industrial site or in the involvement of production plants already present in a given region. A number of factors may promote or prevent the implementation of an EIP: level of analysis; geographic and technical requirements; homogeneity/heterogeneity of industries; stakeholders and local community involvement; regulatory system. We call them Key Drivers. Industrial cluster is the referential model of territorial agglomeration of companies; it has been proven to be one of the best models of Italian industrial development in terms of efficiency and flexibility, with a strong involvement of local community. EIPs could be considered a viable solution to increase sustainability and competitiveness of existing industrial clusters, exploiting common features of both models, primarily, the geographic proximity of companies. However, also in countries characterized by a large diffusion of industrial clusters, such as Italy, there are no operating EIPs. This paper presents the results of a research project, originally aimed at revitalizing a historical chemical site located in Bussi sul Tirino (Abruzzo Region-Italy) through the application of IE principles. Furthermore, the role of Key Drivers in the specific context of existing industrial cluster is analysed. Empirical evidences show a particular suitability of the Bussi Chemical Site to evolve into an EIP, leading towards economic, environmental and social benefits. The involvement of neighbouring industrial clusters and the establishment of new companies in the chemical site are considered in potential scenarios design. Results also point out that the history of the long-standing industrial cluster influenced the presence and the role played by some Key Drivers, especially local community, which proved to be crucial in preventing the full implementation of the EIP.

Hence, a comprehensive assessment of the impact of climate change on coastal catchments is a challenging task. In the present study, a coupled groundwater-surface water model is forced by dynamically downscaled results from a general circulation model. The effects on water quantity and quality of a relatively large lake used for water supply are analyzed. Although stream inflow to the lake is predicted to decrease during summer, the storage capacity of the lake is found to provide a sufficient buffer to support sustainable water abstraction in the future. On the other hand, seawater intrusion into the stream is found to be a significant threat to the water quality of the lake, possibly limiting its use for water supply and impacting the aquatic environment. Additionally, the results indicate that the nutrient load to the lake and adjacent coastal waters is likely to increase significantly, which will increase eutrophication and have negative effects on the surface water ecology. The hydrological impact assessment is based on only one climate change projection; nevertheless, the range of changes generated by other climate models indicates that the predicted results are a plausible realization of climate change impacts. The problems identified here are expected to be relevant for many coastal regimes, where the hydrology is determined by the interaction between saline and fresh groundwater and surface water systems.},

This research presents a summary of the local efforts in China's ecological industrial parks (EIPs) to assess GHG emissions and identify potential mitigation measures. Through field study and interviews in Suzhou Industrial Park (SIP), in Jiangsu Province, we conducted an energy-based GHG emissions inventory for SIP area from 2005-2010, with forecasts to 2015. The area emitted a total of 10.30 MMT CO2E in 2010. Three development strategies including business-as-usual (BAU), existing and pending regulations (EPR) and voluntary mitigating efforts (VME) were introduced to estimate the energy-related GHG emissions in 2015. The results projected that emissions will increase to 17.16 Mt in 2015 with no change in policy or practice, but 3.42 Mt of emissions are avoidable with full compliance with national and provincial energy policies (1.41 Mt), as well as local efforts (2.01 Mt).

Energy intensive industries, such as steel, cement, paper, and power plants, have great capacities to accept waste plastics and paper to substitute their fossil resource consumption and to reduce carbon emissions. We propose a “smart recycling system” that utilizes existing industrial facilities that have high energy efficiency, for establishing a cost-effective and robust recycling system. The core of the smart recycling system is the smart recycling center (SRC) that establishes a new recycling pathway connecting spatially diffuse municipal sources to facilities in energy intensive industries. This paper discusses the design and function of an SRC and estimates the CO2 emissions and costs related to the operation and construction of the SRC. We also evaluated the cost effectiveness of the smart recycling system, taking into account sorted collection, incineration, processes in the SRC, and processes in industrial facilities. We estimated that the system could result in a reduction of approximately 100 kg of CO2 emissions per capita per year without a significant increase in cost. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Also, although the dimensions influence both the urban and dispersed elements of the communities, the strength of the relationships is substantially greater if those elements are considered as a symbiotic whole. Throughout, net rural local density (as opposed to gross density) is shown to be a consistently important dimension of rural communities in relatively sparsely settled lands such as those of south-eastern Australia, supported by the important subsidiary influence of relative settlement dispersal and town size.

Life cycle assessment (LCA) has been used to identify engineering solutions to sustainability during the development of green building products. The new process and the related LCA are framed within a meaningful case of industrial symbiosis, where multiple waste streams are utilised in a multi-output industrial process. The input is a mix of rejected waste glass from conventional container glass recycling and waste special glass such as monitor glass, bulbs and glass fibres. The green building product is a recycled foam glass (RFG) to be used in high efficiency thermally insulating and lightweight concrete. The environmental gains have been contrasted against induced impacts and improvements have been proposed. Recovered co-products, such as glass fragments/powders, plastics and metals, correspond to environmental gains that are higher than those related to landfill avoidance, whereas the latter is cancelled due to increased transportation distances. In accordance to an eco-efficiency principle, it has been highlighted that recourse to highly energy intensive recycling should be limited to waste that cannot be closed-loop recycled.

While many implicit references to social characteristics exist throughout the literature, there have been few explicit attempts to operationalize and measure the concepts.

In this article we explore the relationships among various aspects of social embeddedness, social capital, and IS. We develop a conceptual framework and an approach using quantitative and qualitative methods to identify and measure these social characteristics, including social network structure, communication, and similarities in norms and conceptions of waste, and apply them in an industrial network in Nanjangud, South India. The findings suggest that there is a fairly high level of shared norms about dealing with wastethe short mental distancein this network, but by-product transactions are only weakly correlated with the structure and content of communication among managers. Replication of this approach can increase the understanding and comparability of the role of social characteristics in eco-industrial activities around the world.},

In particular, it explores the potential for situating a mineral carbonation plant as a carbon sink at the heart of a minerals and energy complex to form an industrial symbiosis. Several resource-intensive industries can be integrated synergistically in this way, to enable a complex that produces energy and mineral products with low net CO2 emissions. An illustrative hypothetical case study of such a system within New South Wales, Australia, has been constructed, on the basis of material and energy flows derived from Aspen modeling of a serpentine carbonation process. The synergies and added value created have the potential to significantly offset the energy and emission penalties and direct costs of CO2 capture and storage. This suggests that greenfield minerals beneficiation and metals refining plants should consider closer integration with the power production and energy provision plants on which they depend, together with a carbon solution, such as mineral carbonation, as a critical element of such integration.

Because more and more attention has been paid to energy security, the coal-chemical industry has become a hot topic and has developed quickly. To improve efficiency and reduce emissions, industrial symbiosis (IS) can be introduced when establishing a coal-chemical eco-industrial system to achieve harmonious development between nature, industry, and society. In order to learn the influence of IS on the current industrial system, a model of coal-chemical eco-industrial systems was built. Using scenario optimization and linear programming, the behaviors and optimal industrial structures of the system under different scenario settings were compared, and industrial ecological analysis was performed. By comparative analysis, results showed that the greatest proportional decrease in the use of coal for coking was 15\% compared with actual data for 2005. The resource-productivity and eco-productivity were 828 yuan/ton and 2.51, which are much higher than the values of 548 yuan/ton and 1.23 in 2005. The symbiosis index and the link density were found to be 0.675 and 1.67, compared with 0.588 and 0.94 in 2005. Research results showed that the coal-chemical eco-industrial system achieved a high value-added utilization of coal and an updated product profile. Such systems will constitute the main direction and the inevitable trend of China's coal utilization in the future, which will reduce the harm to the environment from increased coal use and benefit the energy industry, the economy, and society.},

The results showed that larger eco-towns achieved more savings of virgin materials and higher stability in operation. Large-scale projects tended to locate closer to the users of recycled products than did small-scale projects. For treating similar types of waste, projects producing recycled products for special users (e.g., feedstock to a blast furnace for iron production) tended to locate closer to the users than those not producing for special users. The type of waste had a strong effect on the savings of virgin materials and recycling boundaries, while local factors had significant impacts on operational performance. The results also showed that agglomeration did not significantly contribute to the environmental benefits or operational performance of eco-town projects. Another finding was that national agencies were helpful for facilitating cross-prefecture transportation and long-distance transaction of wastes. Implications of the findings are also discussed.},

The linearization of the problem is based on the necessary conditions of optimality defined by Savelski and Bagajewicz (2000). The approach is validated on a published example involving only one contaminant. In the second part the MILP strategy is implemented for designing an Eco-Industrial Park (EIP) involving three companies. Three scenarios are considered: EIP without regeneration unit, EIP where each company owns its regeneration unit and EIP where the three companies share regeneration unit(s). Three possible regeneration units can be chosen, and the MILP is solved under two kinds of conditions: limited or unlimited number of connections, same or different gains for each company. All these cases are compared according to the global equivalent cost expressed in fresh water and taking also into account the network complexity through the number of connections. The best EIP solution for the three companies can be determined. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Yet, it has been riddled with controversies since its inception, and construction has been interrupted by the courts a number of times for alleged environmental violations. Using Lavasa as an example, I will examine the rise and rise of ecocities in India through their legal and policy context. I will argue that future ecocities in India run the danger of prioritising economic development over environmental sustainability in the absence of strong legal enforcement and monitoring of environmental performance. I conclude that strong environmental policy framing and regulation are crucial in this context if new planned cities in India are to have any potential in addressing the challenges of rapid urbanisation and sustainable development.},

Zeyen based Ciudad Jardin on Ebenezer Howard's garden city ideals and designs, which had gained a strong influence in Germany at that time in architecture and urban planning. Like garden city communities elsewhere, Ciudad Jardin was intended to create an urban environment suffused in ample public and private green spaces. This little-known South American garden city-inspired neighbourhood offers a unique learning opportunity about the role of social and political forces in historic preservation and planning, and about the value of urban planning based on green infrastructure as revealed by a society with comparatively little environmental awareness or historic preservation values.

Accordingly, we use indicators that distinguish between desirability, utility and probability assessments. We compare these assessments within and between various stakeholder groups based on a set of literature-based hypotheses. We constructed six planning scenarios, systematically varied with respect to sustainability for the case study, “Erlenmatt”, a major urban redevelopment area in Switzerland. Three stakeholder groups (housing suppliers, the non-profit \& public sector and housing target groups, n = 80) were investigated. The results of the statistical analyses suggest that more sustainable scenarios are preferred with respect to both their desirability and utility and that their probability is not lower than that of the other scenarios. The non-profit \& public sector is the most pessimistic about the probability of a sustainable district while housing suppliers desire it less. We conclude that such detailed subjective scenario assessments can provide informative and detailed guidance for sustainable urban transition.},

	abstract = {Purpose - This paper provides a structured literature review of sustainability in purchasing and supply management, moving beyond the traditional environmental and social sustainability. The paper reviews the concept of sustainability at three levels of inter-organizational analysis - i.e. dyad, supply chain and network. The paper distils the nature and scope of existing research and synthesizes measures used to research sustainability across organizational boundaries. Design/methodology/approach - This literature review systematically analyzes existing literature. In particular, the review focuses on definitions and measures of sustainable purchasing and supply management to obtain an accurate view of current research. Findings - This paper uncovers two distinct trends in the type of research carried out. First, internal or dyadic issues are in focus and second, a tendency to deal with environmental, as opposed to social, sustainability. Despite the need to look beyond the dyad given the risks associated with the extended network, few studies do so in any of the sustainability dimensions. Research limitations/implications - This review is limited by the method employed focusing on definitions and measures. Although the review considers supply chain and network research, it does so purely from a purchasing perspective, thus excluding issues such as logistics and transport. Practical implications - The paper identifies areas open to future research and provides practical insights into how sustainable purchasing and supply are measured. It also synthesizes existing measures of sustainability at different levels and organizes these into a taxonomy. Originality/value - The paper examines studies across multiple levels of analysis and integrates multiple fields of knowledge to show how research on sustainability in purchasing and supply is structured.},

Design/methodology/approach - This conceptual paper examines the theory of the ecocity and investigates the implications for its proposed building strategies for university and colleges, as institutions seek to create more sustainable campuses. The paper examines previous efforts to achieve sustainability and how the concept of the eco-campus can be practically and productively applied. Findings - There is no single campus that has fully embraced every facet of sustainability, but numerous HE institutions are strong leaders in diverse areas. The eco-campus model provides concrete principles that proactively address HE institutions' ecological footprints and develops sustainable community practices. Social implications Sustainability is a pressing social issue. As world leaders in research, innovation, and education, universities and colleges are key places to address this global issue and foster progressive action within current and future generations. The eco-campus approach represents an opportunity to initiate a cultural paradigm shift, whereby university and colleges become global leaders in sustainability. Originality/value - While sustainability is now a cornerstone of research and teaching, North American HE institutions are faced with the challenge of realigning institutional practices, processes and resources to fully institute sustainability on campus.

It draws attention to the importance of key places as conduits in the transformation of materials and secondary processing; emphasizes their importance as sites of symbiotic activity; and shows how such places exemplify economies of recycling, reuse, and remanufacturing, but in conditions of minimal environmental regulation. It therefore shows that contemporary symbiosis is not necessarily clean and green and may be very messy; that it can be generative of agglomerations, not just dependent upon prior agglomerations; that such agglomerations may be cross sectoral, not just interplant; and that symbiosis needs to be thought of not just through geographic proximity, but through the spatialities of globalization.},

The quick growth of the wind power generation industry has promoted the development of the Chinese wind turbine manufacturing industry. Similarly, the quantity and the productivity of the local Chinese Wind Turbine Manufacturers (WTMs) have also undergone a quick and significant expansion. This is resulting in an increase in competition amongst the WTMs in China. Being relatively new, this creates a fertile environment for local Chinese WTMs that is ripe for study and analysis. Based on the niche theory of industrial ecosystem and enterprise, this paper investigates the Chinese wind turbine manufacturing industry, and proposes a wind turbine manufacturing industry ecosystem model and a WTMs' ecological niche evaluation index system (WENEIS). Use is made of a catastrophe theory model evaluation method to evaluate the ecological niche status of the 6 main local Chinese WTMs selected and a spider diagram is established to compare the status of the different enterprises' ecological niche. The proposed WENEIS aids WTMs in finding the competitive advantage and disadvantage factors for their development, as well as providing a valuable reference for the WTMs to improve their business environment and to formulate their competitive strategy in the future.

The article engages in a discussion of what China means by a CE and whether the policies of eco-industrial development being pursued actually fit with this general goal. We also offer our own econometric update on China's progress towards a CE. The article tests the conjecture that China is able to link its `compressed development' strategy with industrial ecology ideas - seeing the CE as not only a source of competitive advantage, but also pointing towards a solution to global resource depletion and waste accumulation and devastation. While it must be understood that China faces enormous obstacles in implementing the CE idea, and starts from a very low base in doing so, nevertheless it has certain latecomer and administrative advantages in putting its economy on a new, closed-loop footing, as compared with more advanced countries with established industrial systems.

	abstract = {Sustainable development or sustainability has been highlighted as an essential principle in urban master planning, with increasing recognition that uncontrollable urbanization may well give rise to various issues such as overexploitation of natural resources, ecosystem destruction, environmental pollution and large-scale climate change. Thus, it is deemed necessary to modify the existing urban and regional administrative system so as to cope with the challenges urban planning is being confronted with and realize the purpose of urban sustainability. This paper contributed to proposing a mechanism which helps to make urban planning with full consideration of issues with respect to sustainable development. We suggested that the integration of urban planning, SEA and ecological planning be a multi-win strategy to offset deficiency of each mentioned political tool being individually applied. We also proposed a framework where SEA and ecological planning are fully incorporated into urban planning, which forms a two-way constraint mechanism to ascertain environmental quality of urban planning, although in practice, planning and SEA processes may conditionally be unified. Moreover, as shown in the case study, the integration of the three political tools may be constrained due to slow changes in the contextual factors, in particular the political and cultural dimensions. Currently within the context of China, there may be three major elements which facilitate integration of the three political tools, which are (1) regulatory requirement of PEIA on urban planning, (2) the promotion or strong administrative support from government on eco-district building, and (3) the willingness of urban planners to collaborate with SEA experts or ecologists.

	abstract = {Industrial parks play a significant role in the production and use of goods and services. However, this also means that the environmental problems of each company are concentrated in a relatively small area. One of these problems is solid waste disposal, which has become a critical issue because of its negative impacts as well as the resources consumed. Integrated solid waste management integrates cleaner and more sustainable production strategies by reducing resource consumption and applying mechanisms found in natural ecosystems to industrial systems. Nevertheless, one of the necessary conditions for the design of such a system is a preliminary study of waste generation management in the area. The study presented in this paper characterizes industrial waste production and management in the metropolitan area of Granada (Spain), and analyzes its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. A similar typology of industrial activities, mainly in the distribution and transportation sector, as well as the proximity of various industrial parks could facilitate their partnership in environmental management. The results obtained in our study point to significant weaknesses in the system, such as the lack of effective waste management tools and training for waste management personnel. Other weaknesses were, the low percentage of selective waste collection and the existence of unauthorized collectors. The paper concludes with specific proposals for waste collection. These recommendations include the creation of the following: (i) a community responsible for waste management; (ii) recycling points in industrial parks: (iii) energy recovery from the waste; (iv) a market to sell, buy, and/or exchange waste; (v) one authorized set of waste management agents that would provide the advantages of an economy of scale.

We focus on the EU End of Waste (EoW) policy, which aims at reducing negative impacts on the environment through the minimization of generated waste. At the same time, the EU climate objectives set challenging goals for the industry to lower greenhouse gas emissions. We argue that the goals of these two policies are conflicting: under certain circumstances, the EoW will lead into increased greenhouse gas emissions because of a number of negative feedback effects that function on multiple spatial and temporal scales. To assess the effects of waste recovery on greenhouse gas emissions, we carry out a consequential life-cycle inventory on a proposed industrial ecosystem around the Gulf of Bothnia between Finland and Sweden. The system recovers currently unutilized steelmaking dust and slag from four steel mills in Finland and Sweden and converts them into iron and zinc raw materials in a novel rotary hearth furnace. The recovered iron is led back into the blast furnace of one of the steel mills and zinc is treated in an existing zinc plant. In the European scale, the model system is significant in size, serving thus as a model for integrated EoW and carbon footprint assessments in other similar cases within the EU. The analysis reveals the relative greenhouse gas emissions from raw material extraction and production, heat and power generation, transport and the production process itself, in comparison to the present system with limited material recovery. To test the model viability, we conduct a sensitivity analysis with respect to increasing energy and production capacity. Our analysis shows that from the point of view of a single operator, material recovery may bring noteworthy reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. If the scale of the assessment is expanded beyond the confines of a single plant, however, we find limited potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions through further recovery of steelmaking residues. In conclusion, we provide policy recommendations with which the EoW paradigm can provide better support for climate change mitigation on a regional scale. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Outwork builds upon the excess commuting and sketch modelling literatures, with a greater focus on energy consumption as a specific objective and improved model performance. After validating the model with the case of a UK eco-town, Monte Carlo analysis is used to assess how the minimum energy benchmark varies in response to planning constraints on high-density housing and car ownership. The methodology presented here therefore offers a new tool for calculating absolute minimum urban energy benchmarks, which can be used early in the planning process to complement more behaviourally-realistic land-use transportation models.

	abstract = {Rising fuel prices, increasing costs associated with emissions of green house gases and the threat of global warming make efficient use of energy more and more important. Industrial clusters have the potential to significantly increase energy efficiency by energy collaboration. In this paper Sweden's largest chemical cluster is analysed using the total site analysis (TSA) method. TSA delivers targets for the amount of utility consumed and generated through excess energy recovery by the different processes. The method enables investigation of opportunities to deliver waste heat from one process to another using a common utility system. The cluster consists of 5 chemical companies producing a variety of products, including polyethylene (PE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), amines, ethylene, oxygen/nitrogen and plasticisers. The companies already work together by exchanging material streams. In this study the potential for energy collaboration is analysed in order to reach an industrial symbiosis. The overall heating and cooling demands of the site are around 442 MW and 953 MW, respectively. 122 MW of heat is produced in boilers and delivered to the processes. TSA is used to stepwise design a site-wide utility system which improves energy efficiency. It is shown that heat recovery in the cluster can be increased by 129 MW, i.e. the current utility demand could be completely eliminated and further 7 MW excess steam can be made available. The proposed retrofitted utility system involves the introduction of a site-wide hot water circuit, increased recovery of low pressure steam and shifting of heating steam pressure to lower levels in a number heat exchangers when possible. Qualitative evaluation of the suggested measures shows that 60 MW of the savings potential could to be achieved with moderate changes to the process utility system corresponding to 50\% of the heat produced from purchased fuel in the boilers of the cluster. Further analysis showed that after implementation of the suggested energy efficiency measures there is still a large excess of heat at temperatures of up to 137 degrees C. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {The industrial park of Herdersbrug (Brugge, Flanders, Belgium) comprises 92 small and medium-sized enterprises, a waste-to-energy incinerator, and a power plant (not included in the study) on its site. To study the carbon dioxide (CO(2)) neutrality of the park, we made a park-wide inventory for 2007 of the CO(2) emissions due to energy consumption (electricity and fossil fuel) and waste incineration, as well as an inventory of the existing renewable electricity and heat generation. The definition of CO(2) neutrality in Flanders only considers CO(2) released as a consequence of consumption or generation of electricity, not the CO(2) emitted when fossil fuel is consumed for heat generation. To further decrease or avoid CO(2) emissions, we project and evaluate measures to increase renewable energy generation. The 21 kilotons (kt) of CO(2) emitted due to electricity consumption are more than compensated by the 25 kt of CO(2) avoided by generation of renewable electricity. Herdersbrug Industrial Park is thus CO(2) neutral, according to the definition of the Flemish government. Only a small fraction (6.6\%) of the CO(2) emitted as a consequence of fossil fuel consumption (heat generation) and waste incineration is compensated by existing and projected measures for renewable heat generation. Of the total CO(2) emission (149 kt) due to energy consumption (electricity + heat generation) and waste incineration on the Herdersbrug Industrial Park in 2007, 70.5\% is compensated by existing and projected renewable energy generated in the park. Forty-seven percent of the yearly avoided CO(2) corresponds to renewable energy generated from waste incineration and biomass fermentation.},

It is now indispensable for the nation to alter its course of development into more sustainable paths in terms of energy and resource efficiency. In this paper, we discuss the energy intensity of the industrial sectors of the Yangtze River Delta, consisting of Shanghai City and the neighboring province of Jiangsu-the fastest economically developing region of the country-and argue possible strategies for energy efficient industrial activities there. We first examine the historical trends of energy intensity associated with industrial sectors and study the factors affecting the evolution of these trends by applying decomposition analysis. We then argue that if “business as usual” (BAU) development patterns are continued, energy intensity level in both regions may surpass China's policy targets in 2010, and GDP growth as well as energy consumption will exceed possible pathways under current policy targets by 2020. Thus, appropriate measures are urgently needed to lower energy intensity and consumption. Based upon these analyses as well as the Chinese government's policy orientation, we propose two options as alternative scenarios for improving practices in energy-intensive industries, particularly targeting the cement and steel production sectors. These options are: (1) diffusion of highly energy efficient technologies into these industries, and (2) promotion of a circular economy and industrial symbiosis. We highlight that these options can potentially lead to energy savings and reductions in resource consumption associated with industrial activities and can serve as a regional model for more sustainable industrial activities in China.},

In this article, we review a number of the eco-industrial initiatives taken in China and compare them using a common graphical representation with comparable initiatives taken in the West and elsewhere in East Asia. Our aim is to demonstrate some common themes across the case studies, such as the transformation from the former linear economy to a circular economy and the evolutionary processes in which dynamic linkages are gradually established over time. We discuss the drivers of these eco-industrial initiatives as well as the inhibitors, setting the initiatives in an evolutionary framework and introducing a notion of Pareto eco-efficiency to evaluate them.

Its use of the results by the RTS as parameters for self-organization proactively could prevent sudden system failures.

These species have distinctive functional characteristics and collaborate by message passing over the mobile Internet, which supports wireline and wireless communications in a mixed dynamic manner. The unpredictable traffic changes in such an environment could reduce system performance and lead to system instability and even failure.

In Africa and other developing countries where rural poverty is quite peaked, gross lack of capital and infrastructure often combine with severe shortage of active labour force to deepen this vortex of rural neglect and deprivation. Amidst what seems like a see-saw growth toggle between the urban and rural spheres, attention is naturally drawn to those compensatory mechanisms that act to alleviate the severe rural-urban development imbalance. In Africa, and perhaps some other non-Western societies, where kinship and community ties are extensive, circular migration and associated exchanges between the urban areas and the rural `hometowns' are resulting in somewhat curious `culturally and economically integrated systems'. At the backdrop of the reification of rural-urban linkages approach by UN Habitat, the paper explores myriad dimensions of this persisting rural-urban `symbiosis' in Southeast Nigeria. Specifically, the paper employs a case study of Ajalli-a small but aspiring local community in Orumba North Local Government Area (LGA) of Anambra State-to confirm whether or not the rural-centric trends orchestrated by circular (rural-urban) migration and the people's associational life do contribute significantly to rural community development. While framing these self-help development initiatives as object cases of Public-Private-Community Participation (PPCP), the paper points the attention of urban planners to the evolving rural-urban nexuses and the new planning mandate they are instigating.

This synthesis was achieved through scientometrical analyses of a worldwide collection of publications. The aim was to develop a conceptual sugarcane supply chain framework and to evaluate research trends, knowledge gaps and limitations. Key system properties were identified from the literature and co-word analyses were carried out. Several exploratory exercises were executed on the co-occurrence matrix using the PAJEK software. The literature generally focuses on material handling issues in isolation from other factors, such as collaboration, information sharing and innovation. Impacts of harvesting on downstream processes remain a pertinent research topic. Also, emerging alternative products impose new complexities on the supply chain. Conflicting grower miller relationships still suppress collaboration in most parts of the world. Mathematical modelling is a popular technique to produce innovative system improvements. Models, however, tend towards finding long-term solutions and lack the development of operational short-term applications. Production risk is an area that needs more focus.

	abstract = {Cement plants and power plants are two of the most significant sources of greenhouse gases emissions. Many CO2 reduction options have been proposed in literature for both sectors. They are mainly focused on CO2 capture in power plants, but, in the short-term, industrial processes are going to play an important role in achieving this objective. In particular, one of the disadvantages in cement plants is that CO2 has two sources: fuel combustion and lime calcination. For this reason, proposed solutions could partially reduce a limited quantity of emissions. The sector is forced to use CO2 capture systems for further reductions. Preliminary results about the implementation of post-combustion and oxyfuel combustion systems for CO2 capture show low energetic penalties and important emissions reduction. Nevertheless, a detailed analysis, not only of CO2 emissions, but of raw materials and its disposal, primary energy and waste energy, could give optimum results from an environmental, energetic, and economic perspective. The combination/integration by industrial symbiosis of a power plant, a cement plant and a CO2 capture system is proposed in this work. Calcium-looping is chosen as the most suitable CO2 capture option for this application. The re-use of waste CaO coming from CO2 capture in the cement plant, and the utilization of waste energy from a clinker cooling and capture system to produce additional power are the main advantages of this proposal. Process flow diagrams and heat and mass balances are calculated and presented in this work. Results show a low value of the CO2 avoided cost, 12.4 (sic)/t, that is smaller than in any other combination of power plant with capture system or cement plant plus capture system, making this proposal economically very attractive. Moreover, an important amount of CO2 emissions is avoided -94\% - due to the energetic efficiency augmentation, the reduction of raw and decarbonizated materials, and the CO2 capture system.

Moreover, the system is analyzed further in order to identify possibilities for additional links between the actors. The results show that of the total life cycle impacts of the system, upstream processes made the greatest overall contribution to the results. Comparison with stand-alone production shows that in the case studied, the industrial symbiosis results in modest improvements, 5\% to 20\% in most impact categories, in the overall environmental impacts of the system. Most of the benefits occur upstream through heat and electricity production for the local town. All in all it is recommended that when the environmental impacts of industrial symbiosis are assessed, the impacts occurring upstream should also be studied, not only the impacts within the ecosystem.},

However, considering the increased consumption of energy services (especially electricity), and the stochastic nature of some of the most promising renewable energies (wind for instance), the challenge is to find the optimal mix of technologies that will provide the energy services, without increasing the CO2 emissions, but nonetheless ensuring reliability of supply. The focus of this paper is to present the DESDOP tool, based on mixed integer linear optimisation technics, that helps giving insight in the optimal mix of technologies that will simultaneously help decrease the emissions while at the same time guarantee resilience of supply. The results show that while it is not yet possible to avoid electricity from the grid completely (hence nuclear or fossil fuel), CO2 reductions up to 20\%, at no extra costs compared to the business-as-usual case, are easily achievable.

To help drive the required behaviour change for increased sustainable practice the Government in England signalled up in the Strategy the intention to launch a Zero Waste Places (ZWP) initiative to develop innovative and exemplary practice. By inviting places (including cities, towns and rural communities) to bid for ZWP status, the successful applicants were then expected to become exemplars of good environmental practice on all waste issues. The ZWP programme commenced in October 2008 with the selection of 6 distinct places based upon an application by a partnership containing a Local Authority or in one case a Regional Development Agency. The places ranged in size from the very small (one street of 201 properties) to a Region of England (5 million population). These 6 were chosen from an initial list of 12 applicants via a rigorous selection process against fixed criteria that were designed to support Zero Waste practice. The funding was (sic)70,258 and the mean was (sic)11,709. The overall assessment suggests that the Local Authorities and their project partners rose to the challenge of zero waste and in most cases met or even exceeded their objectives (meeting at least 80\% of aims and planned actions) and achieved high value for money in terms of Government funded initiatives. Evaluation suggested that there is a requirement to link, in the future, ZWP initiatives with other recent developments such as Transition Towns, Eco-Town and Total Place developments within Local Authorities. A Certificated Standard for ZWP was developed and is perceived as being both useful and valuable and it is hoped that it will spur a large number of new ZWP applications. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

However, quantitative assessments on the environmental benefits of urban symbiosis, especially in developing countries, are limited because only a limited number of planned synergistic activities have been successful and it is difficult to acquire detailed inventory data from private companies. This paper modifies and applies a two-step simulation system and used it to assess the potential environmental benefits, including the reduction of GHG emissions and saving of fossil fuels, by employing various Japanese plastics recycling/energy-recovery technologies in Shenyang, China. The results showed that among various recycling/energy-recovery technologies, the mechanical waste plastics recycling technology, which produces concrete formwork boards (NF boards), has the greatest potential in terms of reducing GHG emissions (1.66 kg CO(2)e/kg plastics), whereas the technology for the production of refuse plastic fuel (RPF) has the greatest potential on saving fossil fuel consumption (0.77 kgce/kg-plastics). Additional benefits can be gained by applying combined technologies that cascade the utilization of waste plastics. Moreover, the development of clean energy in conjunction with the promotion of new waste plastics recycling programs could contribute to additional reductions in GHG emissions and fossil fuel consumption.

Developing ecologically conscious industrial park management requires analysis of both industrial and ecological systems. Traditional evaluation methods based on neoclassical economics and embodied energy and exergy analyses have certain limitations due to their focus with environmental issues considered secondary to the maximization of economic and technical objectives. Such methods focus primarily on the environmental impact of emissions and their economic consequences. These approaches ignore the contribution of ecological products and services as well as the load placed on environmental systems and related problems of carrying capacity of economic and industrial development. This paper presents a new method, based upon emergy analysis and synthesis. Such a method links economic and ecological systems together, highlighting the internal relations among the different subsystems and components. The emergy-based method provides insight into the environmental performance and sustainability of an industrial park. This paper depicts the methodology of emergy analysis at the industrial park level and provides a series of emergy-based indices. A case study is investigated and discussed in order to show the emergy method's practical potential. Results from DEDZ (Dalian Economic Development Zone) case show us the potential of emergy synthesis method at the industrial park level for environmental policy making.

	abstract = {Member enterprises have a vital effect on the stability and system efficiency of an eco-industrial park (EIP), and a selection and control for them is an important part. This paper proposes a new method which is an establishment of both an access indicator system and an extendable optimal degree evaluation model. The indicator system comprises seven primary indicators and twenty-seven secondary indicators. The first three primary indicators, matching the existing industrial chains or not, park capacity and park environmental performance improvement, are proposed from the perspective of an EIP. The others including eco-design, economic benefit, utilization of resources, and pollution control, are suggested from the point of view of enterprises. This new access indicator system provides a basis for evaluating candidate enterprises. The extendable optimal degree evaluation which was proposed by Prof. Caiwen is a method to assess the satisfactoriness of all the indicators and to assign an optimal degree order to each candidate enterprise accordingly. There are four steps to conduct the evaluation after establishing the access indicator system: (1) selecting correlation function; (2) calculating correlations; (3) assigning weights and current values of indicators; and (4) calculating the optimal degree of all the candidate enterprises. The enterprises can be ranked based on optimal degree results. The highest-ranked enterprise should have the highest priority of entering the EIP. This study provides the specifics of applying the method by examining the case of Yantai Economy Technology Development Zone EIP (YTEIP) in Shandong province. The method provides a practical tool for controling enterprise access to an EIP. However, the reasonability and validity of indicators and effectiveness of the established method of extendable optimal degree evaluation merit further studies. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

For green process design this involves starting the design decisions as early as chemical and material selection stages on one end, and managing and planning decisions at the other end. However, uncertainties and multiple and conflicting objectives are inherent in such a design process. Uncertainties increase further in industrial ecology. The concept of overall sustainability goes beyond industrial ecology and brings in time dependent nature of the ecosystem and multi-disciplinary decision making. Optimal control methods and theories from financial literature can be useful in handling the time dependent uncertainties in this problem. Decision making at various stages starting from green process design, green energy, to industrial ecology, and sustainability is illustrated for the mercury cycling. Power plant sector is a major source of mercury pollution. In order to circumvent the persistent, bioaccumulative effect of mercury, one has to take decisions at various levels of the cycle starting with greener power systems, industrial symbiosis through trading, and controlling the toxic methyl mercury formation in water bodies and accumulation in aquatic biota.

The process environmental impact (El) is calculated using the Waste Reduction Algorithm, while Profit (P) is estimated using classic cost correlations. MATLAB (The Mathworks Inc) is connected to UNISIM to enable optimization. The objective is granting maximum process sustainability, which involves finding a compromise between high profitability and low environmental impact. Sustainability maximization is therefore understood as a multi-criteria optimization problem, addressed by means of the Pareto optimization methodology for trading off P vs. El.},

Despite its obvious relevance to regional science, economic geography, and urban economics, the issue is only beginning to be addressed in these subdisciplines. This situation is paradoxical as both recovery linkages and the very concept of IS were discussed in some depth by numerous economists and geographers several decades ago. The goals of this article are to document this intellectual history, in the process gaining a better understanding of the phenomenon while shedding additional light on current controversies. In doing so, the authors further hope to restimulate economists, geographers, and regional scientists' interest in the topic and to illustrate the long-standing importance of geographical co-location in facilitating the `'internalization of externalities” of industrial operations.},

The three dimensions collectively form for each trade region a specific ECOL niche that is concurrently subject to national variation.

Nevertheless, this tentative finding seems not to hold for those corporations that seek out strong ECOL niche countries like Costa Rica.

Accordingly, residents in rural regions usually pump groundwater for irrigation and daily needs. Continuous land subsidence has resulted in the elevation of the ground surface to be lower than the sea level, which has led to frequent flooding and created wetland habitats. In addition, seawater intrusion has damaged the soil, which has made the land difficult to farm. This study proposes a novel concept called the Island Lake Eco-town Program that would send the surface runoff from stormwater into a flood buffer wetland through land elevation modification and the necessary levee construction. Except for the use of stormwater to leach salt from the soil, we propose growing salt tolerant crops. Yunlin County of Taiwan has been selected as a study area to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed method. This study also demonstrated how to evaluate the available production of rice growth in saline soils.},

However, biodiesel production generates large amounts of waste and wastewater. This research aspires to adopt industrial ecology measures to alleviate environmental problems encountered in the biodiesel industry in Thailand. The proposed implementation options included clean technology and waste exchange measures. Five biodiesel production factories were selected to analyse material flow and balance in the production processes. The results show that 1 m3 biodiesel production generated 8kg of spent bleaching earth, 140kg of glycerine and 0.50m3 of wastewater with a chemical oxygen demand (COD) content of up to 170,000mg/L. The postulated options, on the basis of clean technology, included methanol recovery from the methyl ester and glycerine mixture, substitution of the hydroxide catalyst by methoxide, and reuse of the final washing water used in the methyl ester purification step. These options are expected to reduce raw material and water use in the production processes. The wastes or by-products generated from the biodiesel production process can be utilised as raw material for other industries. Crude glycerine, which is produced in large quantities from the trans-esterification process, can be reused or recycled by a value-added conversion for other industries. In addition, the biodiesel wastewater mostly obtained from the methyl ester washing process can be treated in an anaerobic digestion system to produce biogas for electricity generation.},

	abstract = {The recycling of scrap material has been identified as an important strategy in the larger theory of industrial ecology. Industrial ecology argues that the traditional model of industrial activity needs to be transformed into a `closed loop' industrial ecosystem where used materials (scrap) and by-products would substitute for virgin materials during production processes. The recycling of scrap material forms part of this larger effort to reduce the overall environmental impact of production and consumption. A key, but as yet, unresolved question in this process is the geographic scale (local, regional, national, global) at which loop closing should take place. This preliminary empirical research examines the export and import geography of the seven largest (by weight) US scrap commodities (iron and steel, paper, plastics, aluminium, copper, nickel and zinc) between 1995 and 2005 to ascertain the extent to which US scrap flows overseas and how that might affect our understanding of how material loops can close. Other than an integrated export and import relationship with Canada, the results suggest that there are two distinct circuits of scrap flows in the USA. The USA exports a substantial portion of the recyclable scrap generated each year to rapidly developing countries, while importing smaller quantities of scrap from the EU. With the major exception of exporting higher value iron and steel scrap to China, the US tends to export lower value scrap and import higher value scrap. In part this reflects imbalances in the supply and demand for scrap between the USA and the developing world, the lack of potentially available scrap and the absence of a robust recycling infrastructure in the developing world. Although such scrap circuits are probably not ideal, the use of US scrap in the developing world is both a realistic and preferable alternative in the short to medium term than virgin production.},

We first provide an overview related to industrial ecology education in China and then present a detailed description of eight teaching modules focused on industrial ecology at DUT: history and evolution of IE, cleaner production, life cycle management, design for environment, integrated waste management, industrial symbiosis and eco-industrial parks, circular economy, and sustainable consumption. Particular attention is given to teaching methodology. All lectures and discussions are in English; written assignments and verbal presentations in English are required, as is a final research paper and extensive use of Chinese and international case studies. Overall pedagogy emphasizes active learning and critical reflection. The grading system relies on individual written assignments, an oral presentation, participation, and a research paper. Challenges encountered include the difficulties for some students due to their limited competency in the English language, facilitating students to shift from passive to active learning, and attracting management students to the course. Postcourse evaluations indicated that the students' understanding of industrial ecology increased.},

The singular value decomposition aggregation method is employed to verify the rationality of evaluation result.

A cyclic material flow with alternative usage of all materials in the loop is an essential feature of an eco-industrial network.

An Giang Province has its own market share in the trade of Tra and Basa fish. The industries in the value chain of Tra and Basa are in a situation that forces them to improve their competitiveness to retain the market share. It was found that forming an eco-industrial network and recruiting new businesses to utilize all materials in the process provides additional revenue apart from reducing waste disposal concerns. This paper details the current market situation, the issues faced and material flow patterns and presents a feasible eco-industrial network.

	abstract = {Zero energy consumption. The goal sounds simple and is presented excessively in variations all over the world. Energy and environmental politics demand zero consumption as a long-term goal, marketing has discovered the concept and first buildings and settlements aiming at balanced energy or emission budgets have been constructed. As an example, the German Federal Government specifies in its fifth energy research programme (2005): For new buildings, the goal is to reduce the primary energy demand, i.e. the energy demand for heating, domestic hot water, ventilation, air-conditioning, lighting and auxiliary energy, again by half compared to the current state of the art. The long-term goal is zero-emission buildings. England and the USA aim for zero carbon developments and net-zero energy buildings (DOE, 2009) in political programmes. The Vatican accepted the offer of climatic “indulgence”-and thus became the first country in the world to completely compensate its carbon emission (Spiegel online, 2007). Megaprojects in the growth regions of the Arabian Gulf and China advertise with a CO(2)-neutral balance. A Zero Carbon Community is to be created in Masdar, Abu Dhabi (Foster, 2007), and the first Chinese carbon-neutral ecocity was planned for Dongtan, Shanghai (Pearce, 2009). Not only to aid international communication, but also to further the processes required to solve energy-related problems, it is essential that key words, central concepts, their usage and their relationships be clarified. This article intends to contribute to this clarification based on the monitored example of a solar estate. Net zero energy building, equilibrium building, carbon neutral city-the accounting method varies, depending on motivation and point of view. If the focus is on finite and scarce resources, energy is the currency; CO(2)-equivalent emissions are considered if global warming and public health is the issue; the cost of energy is what concerns a tenant paying for heating and electricity. A balance in one set of units can be converted to another, but the conversion factors often also shift the balance point. Energy will be used as the reference quantity in the following article, which prevents confusion with non-energy measures (e.g. carbon credits for forestry) and avoids the nuclear power debate, in which nuclear power is partly calculated as being CO(2) neutral. The diversity of concepts is an indicator that a scientifically based methodology is still lacking, though initial publications focus hereon (Pless et al. 2009). Since October 2008, a group of experts in the International Energy Agency has been addressing this issue under the beading, Towards Net Zero Energy Solar Buildings (Riley et al. 2008). The goal is to document and analyse outstanding examples that are close to being net zero-energy buildings, and while doing so, to develop the methodology and tools for working with such buildings. The Chair of Technical Building Services, University of Wuppertal, is co-ordinating the methodological work. The zero-energy approach-still under construction-will here be presented using a solar estate as an illustration.},

The area of New Orleans East was particularly devastated, including a cluster of industries, such as a major food-processing plant, manufacturing facilities, and bulk material and gas processors. Although this area was well suited for resource recovery and eco-industrial linkages, little progress has been made in implementation. This article explores New Orleans as a case study in the application of industrial ecology to disaster management. Hurricane Katrina's damage to New Orleans resulted in a significant increase in the amount of waste flowing into New Orleans East, which precipitated a massive expenditure of federal funds toward debris management. Those circumstances created an unprecedented opportunity to capitalize a resource recovery program and to establish eco-industrial relationships, both of which would have resulted in new jobs and environmental improvement. Yet straightforward opportunities for resource recovery and eco-industrial linkage were overlooked or dismissed, in spite of antilandfill activism from the environmental community and formal recommendations for recycling from scientists and other professionals. We describe the specific resource recovery and eco-industrial opportunities that were available to New Orleans East, especially those that were magnified by Hurricane Katrina, and analyze the barriers that prevented their actualization. We also provide recommendations for overcoming barriers to resource recovery and eco-industrial progress with the goal that future postcatastrophe scenarios may benefit from more effective use of relief and recovery funding.},

The sustainable future of viable multifunctional biosphere landscapes and their biological and cultural richness can only be ensured by a post-industrial symbiosis between nature and human society. To conserve and restore the rapidly vanishing and degrading Mediterranean biosphere landscapes, a mindset shift of scientists and professionals from narrow disciplinarity to transdisciplinarity is necessary, dealing with land-use planning and management in close cooperation with land users and stakeholders. Their highest biological, ecological, and cultural landscape ecodiversity can be attained only by maintaining their dynamic homeorhetic flow equilibrium, continuing or simulating all natural and anthropogenic processes.

Although both these models address waste, there is surprisingly little consideration of industrial symbiosis within supply chain research. Yet, industrial symbiosis has much to offer the study of sustainable development within supply chains. Industrial symbiosis emphasizes community, cooperation and coordination among firms, which serves to protect the environmental integrity, social equity and economic prosperity of the region - all hallmarks of sustainable development. However, such tight integration among a diverse set of organizations is difficult to jump start and difficult to maintain. In this paper, we also outline the challenges and offer some ideas on how to address these challenges. We ground our insights from interviews with firms in the Sarnia-Lambton region of Ontario, Canada. This region is home to over 130,000 people, and has a strong physical infrastructure and social structures that have facilitated symbiotic relationships among local businesses.},

	abstract = {Opportunities and Preconditions of Public Participation in Sustainable Settlement Development. Public participation is a comprehensive social science concept that is of interdisciplinary character, with the impact on the society. This paper concentrates on public participation in settlement development at the local level in Slovakia as well as in international context. It takes into consideration social and historical origins of participation and reflects some issues of citizen participation in the development of settlement structures in Slovakia. The significance of citizen participation in settlement development lies in the fact that citizens create their settlement environment according to their social needs and at the same time under this process they get changed too. Participating citizens cease being apathetic towards their social and settlement environment and take responsibility for the activities within their communities. It is a continual process of improving the settlement conditions and its implication is to reach the wishful shape of environment and to develop local community with its identity and social cohesion. Citizen participation connects personal and group interests as well as the interests of local communities with public well-being. The paper points out the mechanisms of participation in the settlement development and clarifies the legal framework for public participation in the Slovak as well as in the international context. At the same time the paper points out the prevailing forms of participatory projects, based on the principles of partnership and cooperation, the objective of which was to coordinate mutual activities of the stakeholders oriented towards solutions of local and regional issues of the settlements in Slovakia. Several identified issues of the citizen participation at the local level are brought forward. They are based on the results from sociological surveys of local democracy and the process of participation has been illustrated by the contextual analysis of the implemented citizen participation project in the frame of an international research and development project “Ecocity”.

	abstract = {On the basis of principle of energy cascade utilization, a reconstruction scheme for eco-industrial park, which adopts diesel engines, absorption chiller, liquid dehumidification process and biogas generation to produce cooling, heating and power, is proposed in this paper. The major component of the recommended system is composed of four sets of diesel engines, which produce electricity for the industrial park. Waste heat from engines, including the heat from the exhaust gas and the heat from jacket cooling water, is utilized for absorption refrigeration and for driving the liquid dehumidification process, respectively. Moreover, the wastewater and biomass energy from the living area are recovered to generate biogas, which could be used as fuel for diesel engines. The analysis indicates a superior performance of the recommended system in energy utilization from the viewpoint of the first law and second law of thermodynamics. The energy utilization coefficient, energy saving ratio of fossil fuel (ESRf) and energy efficiency of the recommended system are 84, 34 and 36.22\%, with 20, 14 and 4.55 percentage points higher than that of the existing system. Compared with the existing system, biogas can replace about 1.5\% heavy oil to generate power, whereas the liquid desiccant can provide about 42\% cooling duty to replace the electricity consumption by air-conditioners. The recommended system can reduce CO2 emission by about 48\% compared with the single product systems. The results achieved in this research demonstrate that energy cascade utilization in CCHP can make a significant contribution to energy saving in the eco-industrial park. Complementary utilization of fossil energy and renewable energy can not only reduce environmental pollution but can also save energy for the eco-industrial park.

	abstract = {Eco-industrial parks (EIP) are clusters of industry corporations that collaborate with reusing waste and energy-efficient use of resources with no or minor impact on the environment. This paper presents a case study that examines the feasibility of using gas turbine technology in one industrial park, located in the Dongguan city of the Guangdong province in China. A model of a gas turbine-based combined heat and power (CHP) plant with a heat recovery steam generator for absorption cooling was developed and simulated. A steam-injected gas turbine has been selected in the system to increase electricity production and to generate steam. The study includes performance analysis of the cogeneration plant in terms of thermal efficiency, cost estimation, and greenhouse gas emission. The gas turbine-based cogeneration system has been compared with a baseline reference case that is defined as if all the energy to the industrial park is supplied from the local electricity grid. The results show that the gas turbine-based cogeneration system can reach a total efficiency of 58\% and reduce CO, emissions with 12 700 tons per year. A sensitivity analysis on the costs of the system has also been made based on fuel costs and the interest rate, which shows that the investigated system is economically profitable at natural gas prices below 4.4 RMB m(-3) with fixed electricity prices and at electricity prices above 736 RMB MWh(-1) with fixed natural gas prices. The sensitivity analysis based on the interest rate showed that the proposed system is economically feasible with interest rates up to 16\%. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

By constructing industrial ecosystems, Nanning Sugar Co., Ltd. in China, has achieved the successful transition from a traditional corporation to a sustainable corporation, or rather, a circular corporation. This study expounds on its whole transition course to a circular complex in the past decade, in which four factors are essential to making this symbiosis achievable: rational production structures; raw materials advantages; technical supports and correct diversification. The corporation is in charge of almost all the aspects of its affiliated companies and the management mode, in particular, differing from that of industrial symbiosis systems in Kalundborg, is considered another potential factor contributing to the corporate success. The transition mode in question is hoped to point to a feasible development path for similar corporations. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Firms that engage in IS are said to belong to an industrial ecosystem. Symbiosis has been found to be motivated by economic considerations, such as lowering costs for waste disposal, as well as by environmental ones, such as accessing limited water supplies. Communication and trust among managers are thought to play important roles in exchanges; however, empirical studies have not been previously conducted. This study used social network analysis (SNA) to identify the prevalence of industrial symbiosis linkages in Barceloneta, Puerto Rico. The study quantified patterns in various relationships among firms and managers, including formal relations through supply chains, and informal ones through interpersonal interactions. SNA and statistical methods were used to explore how these ties correlate with observed industrial symbiosis activities. IS linkages were found to be less prevalent than product sales among firms and were concentrated among pharmaceutical firms at the core of the regional network. Trust among managers and position in the social hierarchy were found to be correlated with IS but not supply chain links. SNA was useful for examining the organization of different relationships in the industrial ecosystem, but contextual information is still needed to add meaning to its findings.},

	abstract = {Industrial ecology has emerged as a key strategy for improving environmental conditions. A central element of industrial ecology is the concept of closing the loop in material use (cycling) by directing used material and products (wastes) back to production processes. This article examines the issue of geographic scale and loop closing for heterogeneous wastes through an analysis of the location and materials flows of a set of recycling, remanufacturing, recycling manufacturing, and waste treatment (RRWT) firms in Texas. The results suggest that there is no preferable scale at which loop closing should be organized. RRWT firms are ubiquitous and operate successfully throughout the settlement hierarchy. The cycling boundaries of RRWT firms are dependent primarily upon how and where their products are redirected to production processes rather than the firm's location in the settlement hierarchy. In other words, loop closing is dominated by the spatial economic logic of the transactions of the firm involved. These results suggest that we cannot assign loop closing to any particular spatial scale a priori nor can we conceive of closing the loop via RRWT firms in terms of monolithic networks bounded in space or place with internal material flows.},

As a result of these projects, the quantity of discharged waste water was reduced by a factor of 2 (water recycling doubled from a factor of 10 to a factor of 20), and the discharge of pollutants decreased.

The waste may be referred to as Waelz sintering waste (WSW). The aim of this study is to develop a process for the separation and recovery of the metals from WSW with high purities. The process is based on the dissolution of the WSW in aqueous SO2 solution. The research reported here concentrated on the effect of some important operational parameters on dissolution process. The parameters investigated and their ranges were as follows: SO, gas flow rate (V); 38-590 ml/min, stirring speed (M; 100-1000 rpm, reaction temperature (7); 13-60 degrees C, reaction time (t); 1-16 min, and solid-liquid ratio (S/L); 0.1-0.5 g/ml. The results showed that the dissolution rate increased with increasing W, V, and S/L and decreasing T. The best dissolution conditions were found to be V=325 ml/min, W=600 rpm, t=6 min, T=21 degrees C, and S/L = 0.1 g/ml. Separation of Zn from Cd involved precipitation of ZnSO3 from a mixture solution. The best pH level for the precipitation was observed to be 6. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Throughout the short history of industrial ecology, issues of implementation have been heavily emphasized. Less attention has been given to the ways in which the technical models of industrial ecology interact with social processes. Yet the practitioners of industrial ecology frequently encounter challenges pertaining to contextualization when embedding a general model in different local contexts. In addition, there are reasons to believe that the models of industrial ecological systems become politically meaningful only when they are carefully contextualized and linked to localized needs, In this article, we aim at a better understanding of the political embedding of industrial ecology. In order to demonstrate some general mechanisms of embedding, we first conduct a frame analysis of complex utilization-a scientific policy instrument analogous to industrial ecology, developed in the Kola Peninsula, Russia. We identify five frames in which complex utilization has been promoted between 1935 and 2005. These frames are then compared to six frames identified in the industrial symbiosis in Kalundborg, Denmark. We find that effective political embedding relies on frames that function both on a general level and in specific contexts. General frames, such as efficiency, economy, and environment, need to be aligned with localized perceptions of particular issues. What is more, sensitivity to purely context-specific frames is necessary for effective political embedding. Finally, the political processes of framing also shape the scientific-technical models that are being promoted.},

This circumstance provides a sharp contrast with other countries. As China is so significant in the global economy, studies of its eco-industrial development are very important. In this study we examined the state of eco-industrial development in China and have drawn conclusions from this analysis about some of the future prospects for sustainable development. In the analysis, we investigated the application of industrial ecology concepts by reference to several case studies. We have therefore described the current environmental situation in China, and have provided an overview of eco-industrial development and its implementation. Constraints to industrial sustainability in China have also been examined. We consider that eco-industrial development in China is in its infancy, and that closed loops involving chains and industrial symbiotic webs are the technological key and core of successful initiatives in the application of industrial ecology. In the case studies, we found that each system has different characteristics and management concerns. Our major conclusion is that even though China's Agenda 21 highlights the principles and sets the directions for eco-industrial development, these have not yet become essential ingredients in the country's industrial policy and practice for implementing Agenda 21.

This paper also studies the impact of urban growth and its infrastructures on the environment through the consumption of raw materials and energy. City metabolism is one of the main causes of environmental deterioration, and present-day tendencies make it foreseeable that both urban and infrastructure development shall continue to increase. Although the expression “sustainable construction” is being used more and more, it is necessary to distinguish between the sustainability of the construction activity and the sustainability of works constructed. Both the materials and technologies used since ancient times have allowed many past works to have lasted thousands of years. Some were made out of permanent materials such as stone while others were made out of more ephemeral materials such as adobe bricks or cob walls. Structures built with Roman cement are still standing after 20 centuries. The overall durability of built structures depends on the durability of their materials. Transcendent construction was made possible either using permanent materials or more ephemeral materials, providing the project had taken the need for maintenance into consideration. The development of building works in a modular fashion makes the repairing action of modifying materials or parts of works possible without destroying its basic structure. With our present-day knowledge, plain concrete permits to create transcendent structures that could last several centuries. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In times of declining resources, this principle translates into increased efficiency and optimum use of any kind of waste and co-products. Ecosystems and any self-organizing systems always apply this strategy and their selection-evolution mechanisms are based on their ability of growing on any untapped resource available. In order to do so, they increase the number of components and patterns for resource degradation in order to optimize the resource throughput and power output. Such a strategy also applies to human-dominated, economic systems, where the ability of dealing with co-products and wastes by means of appropriate designs as well as reuse and recycling processes may lead to `' zero-emission `' patterns (increased complexity, optimal resource throughput, minimization of emissions, resource exchange among system's components) and be the key for successful and sustainable development. In this paper Life Cycle Assessment and Emergy Synthesis approaches are suggested as joint tools for qualitative and quantitative evaluation of progresses towards industrial symbiosis and more sustainable production and consumption patterns within a zero emission framework.

Current and projected large-scale hydropower projects pose difficult challenges as well as great hope for development of local impoverished areas. There are great difficulties in coordinating hydropower development and local regional development, owing to gaps in national policies, clear separation between enterprise and local communities, and problems with local management and the local economy. The local government faces the dilemma of supporting national hydropower development on the one hand, and safeguarding the interests of local people on the other. Local regional development requires general planning and a proper national policy for resettling dam migrants. A special national eco-district is proposed to delimit reaches in the upper Yangtze River area that will provide ecological security for the developed reaches and the dams lower down on the Yangtze River.},

The research employed the social amplification of risk framework (SARF) to examine the relationships among culture, place, and socially constructed risk. A total of 44 in-depth, semi-structured interviews were carried out with 33 landowners (farmers, acreage owners), public officials (municipal politicians, administrators), journalists, and industry representatives. Analysis revealed that risk communication occurred in relation to situated experiences of place that were based on conflicting cultural worldviews. The research shows that place is a useful component of the SARF, providing a spatial explanation for why some people amplify, and others attenuate, risks in locally contentious environmental debates.},

The traditional process used for manufacturing chromic oxide from chromite ore has low resources and energy efficiency. Moreover, large quantities of chromium-containing toxic solid wastes are discharged, posing serious pollution concerns. To reduce the environmental impact of this procedure, a new cleaner process was developed by the Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, PR China, based upon the 3Rs (Reduce, Recycle, Reuse) principles of cleaner production and industrial ecology; this new cleaner process utilizes resources more efficiently, and does not discharge emissions of chromium-containing waste residue. A demonstration plant featuring this process, as well as an Eco-Industrial Park (EIP) has been built in He'nan Province, PR China. The new cleaner process is a promising advancement for the industrial production of chromic oxide (Cr2O3) as well as other chromium compounds such as potassium chromate (K2CrO4) and potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7).

	abstract = {Basic aspects of sustainable housing design such as increasing density, mixed use and proximity to public transport are being adopted increasingly in Australian cities. Sustainable building codes such as NSW's BASIX and Victoria's Green Star rating systems are also being implemented and advanced. More substantial improvements and endeavours such as onsite food production, energy generation and waste treatment, are being seen increasingly as necessary for urban sustainability, yet little is being done to institutionalise or normalise these through Australia's housing system. Similarly, concerns about the social sustainability of housing identify the need for mixed, flexible tenure and dwelling types, with again little uptake despite evidence of demand. Given that we seem to know what needs doing to move towards sustainability, this paper investigates two ecologically and socially sound community-based housing developments in Australia, with a view to finding what helped or hindered these efforts and what may further the uptake of sustainable design. Assessment of the uptake of sustainable planning initiatives reveals the prevalence of a decidedly neoliberal agenda which shies away from the more substantial challenges ecocity design and community-based enterprise may represent. Such community-based initiatives must, however, be supported at a broader scale, to avoid possible outsourcing of governmental responsibility or the relegation of sustainable design to the sole realm of the wealthy.},

It relies mainly on the utilization of recovered materials/parts/products in the original and principal production system while their original function is retained at the highest level possible. In this study, advanced loop-closing systems for the recycling of end-of-life vehicles and electric household appliances are first designed in “Hyogo Eco-town.” Second, a methodology for evaluating the eco-efficiency of these systems is developed. Finally, the eco-efficiency of the designed advanced loop-closing strategies for the two products is evaluated, based on the results of materials flow analysis and life-cycle assessment. The results show that, compared with conventional recycling systems, when an industrial complex and an advanced loop-closing system for end-of-life vehicles are established, the total economic value increases by 114\% and the eco-efficiency in terms of the amount of direct material input is improved by 57\%. This system permits the utilization of the by-products, wastes, and recovered materials that originate from other industrial sectors as input to production activities. In the case of end-of-life electric household appliances, an advanced loop-closing strategy to lengthen the product life with parts reuse improves the eco-efficiency in terms of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 4\% compared with the conventional replacement of the appliance with a new product along with the material recycling option.},

Genuine saving rate (GSR), which takes account of various impacts of economic activities including depletion of natural resources, costs of environmental pollution and long-term environmental damage, can be used as an integrated indicator to measure the status quo and potential of sustainability for an ecocity. This paper discusses the concept of an ecocity; and analyses the time-series of GSR in Suzhou between 1991-2001 as a case study used to develop a standard method of measuring sustainability. The status quo and trends in urban sustainability in six case study cities in China are then evaluated and compared. The results show the current status: Suzhou (23.6\%), Guangzhou (18.9\%), Ningbo (14.7\%), Yantai (13.1\%), Yangzhou (11.7\%) and Sanming (7.9\%). The study demonstrates that GSR provides not only a linkage by which local governmental departments for resources management, environmental protection, finance and planning can be connected directly, but also ail effective analytical tool for the planning and construction of an ecocity as well as decision-making support for local governments.},

The study reported in this paper is conducive to optimising land use and to balancing ecosystem services and local economy. The aim is to provide useful information and advice for industrial/mining cities concerned with sustainable development. Wu'an, which is rich in mineral resources and an important energy supplier in Hebei Province, is selected as the study area. The ecosystem service value coefficients of industrial ecosystem and urban ecosystem are estimated adopting the cost method and applied to the city from 1996 to 2005. The temporal and spatial changes of the ESVs estimated within the entire ecosystem, sub-ecosystems and individual ecosystem services are analysed and discussed based on land use. The results show that land use in Wu'an had a great influence on the ESVs and especially the project of converting farmland into forests determined the entire ecosystem structure and functions. Additionally, the study shows the comparing relationships between ecosystem service values and local economy through various mathematical expressions. One significant relationship can be abstracted into an inverse curve (zone) under restrained conditions. The conclusions suggest that the rapid local economy development should build on a reasonable land use with emphasis on the high ecosystem services. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {The concept of industrial symbiosis (IS) over the last 20 years has become a well-recognized approach for environmental improvements at the regional level. Many technical solutions for waste and by-product material, water, and energy reuse between neighboring industries (so-called synergies) have been discovered and applied in the IS examples from all over the world. However, the potential for uptake of new synergies in the regions is often limited by a range of nontechnical barriers. These barriers include environmental regulation, lack of cooperation and trust between industries in the area, economic barriers, and lack of information sharing. Although several approaches to help identify and overcome some of the nontechnical barriers were examined, no methodology was found that systematically assessed and tracked the barriers to guide the progress of IS development. This article presents a new tool—IS maturity grid—to tackle this issue in the regional IS studies. The tool helps monitor and assess the level of regional industrial collaboration and also indicates a potential path for further improvements and development in an industrial region, depending on where that region currently lies in the grid. The application of the developed tool to the Gladstone industrial region of Queensland, Australia, is presented in the article. It showed that Gladstone is at the third (active) stage of five stages of maturity, with cooperation and trust among industries the strongest characteristic and information barriers the characteristic for greatest improvement.},

A novel stability analysis criterion of the symbiotic bioenergy park is developed based on the concept of incremental investment return analysis. The synthesised symbiotic bioenergy park is stable as long as no partner bears a disproportionate share of additional investment costs relative to benefits gained from cooperation. In case the symbiotic bioenergy park is not stable, re-evaluation (e.g., additional incentives from government, subsidies from high profit companies, etc.) can be conducted amongst all participants. In this work, fuzzy optimisation is adapted to trade-off individual economic interest and stability of each processing plant. The optimised network configuration which achieves the targets with minimum biomass value losses can be determined prior to detailed design. A palm-based symbiotic bioenergy park case study is solved to illustrate the proposed approach.},

	abstract = {The low–carbon transition of iron and steel industry is vital for meeting China's CO2 emission reduction targets. Industrial symbiosis provides important opportunities for CO2 abatement in China's integrated steel mills (ISMs). A set of methodological rules were proposed for quantification of CO2 abatement from industrial symbiosis. We defined both cleaner production inside an ISM and synergistic measures with other enterprises as symbiotic measures, and classified them into three groups. Three methods were proposed for quantifying CO2 emission reduction under different data conditions. A case was designed on the basis of a typical ISM in China. The calculation results of our case showed that: 1) the three most effective symbiotic measures for CO2 abatement were blast furnace gas (BFG) recycled on site as fuel and sold off site, coke oven gas (COG) recycled on site as fuel and sold off site, and blast furnace (BF) slag sold to cement industry; 2) at present utilizations of gaseous and solid waste/byproducts far outweighed the use of sensible heat in terms of their contributions to CO2 abatement, which also indicated the abundant potentials in sensible heat recovery; 3) cleaner production inside an ISM contributed more to CO2 abatement than symbiotic measures with other enterprises did, which proved the arguments of other studies. The calculation and analyses of the case tested the applicability of our definition and methodological rules, and provided a reference result for related research. Finally, suggestions were provided for improving the contribution of industrial symbiosis to CO2 abatement in ISMs in China.},

An important pathway to improve regional sustainability is to locally carry out long-term ecological planning. In order to reduce environmental impacts from fast economic growth, several eastern provinces of China began Ecological Province Construction (EPC) at the end of 1990s. This paper presented a case for analyzing the progress of EPC in China via both qualitative and quantitative methods. We studied Shandong Eco-province Construction (SEPC) and evaluated its outcomes with its pre-set indicators in 2003–2010. A further evaluation with eco-efficiency and de-linking indices was conducted. The results indicated the pre-set indicators could not effectively reflect of the ecological province construction. It was recommended to introduce an evaluated framework combined with eco-efficiency and de-linking indices to indicate ecological planning at the regional scale.},

	abstract = {Despite the widespread incorporation of sustainable development into policy discourses, actually achieving the ‘win–win–win’ scenario of economic, environmental and social development continues to be problematic. Advocates of industrial ecology suggest that by shifting the basis of industrial production from a linear to a closed loop system, these gains can be achieved. In recent years, concepts drawn from industrial ecology have been used to plan and develop eco-industrial parks (EIPs) that seek to increase business competitiveness, reduce waste and pollution, create jobs and improve working conditions. Despite a growing interest in EIPs, there have been few empirically informed studies that seek to explore the potential contribution such EIPs may make to sustainable development. This paper contributes to a developing sympathetic critique of industrial ecology by focusing on the key problems and dilemmas that arise in the course of developing eco-industrial parks, drawing upon empirical work conducted in the USA. The paper draws upon both an extensive survey of EIPs and in-depth interviews conducted with a range of stakeholders at ten US sites. As the paper reveals, EIPs in the USA are in their early stages and likewise their contribution to both economic development and environmental policy, let alone social policies, is complicated and inchoate. The empirical material reveals that key features of industrial ecology such as inter-firm networking and collaboration in the form of materials interchange and energy cascading are either absent or in the early planning stages. In each of the ten cases what is emerging is a form of EIP partly determined by the geographic setting and broader economic realities of the locality. While collaborative behaviour between firms is central to EIP development if the potential benefits of industrial ecology are to be realised, it is important to realise that such behaviour is difficult to develop from scratch through policy intervention. In conclusion, the paper suggests that expectations must be realistic for the community and location in question. As part of that realism, EIP projects must be designed to allow for a gradual approach, and each phase needs to be financially viable.},

The water utilization in coal chemical industry was evaluated in Erdos, China. According to the industrial ecology principles, the processes in sectors of pretreatment, desalination, wastewater treatment plant, reuse, recirculation and brine have been fully discussed. The water balance was investigated to evaluate water reuse, reaching efficiencies of 70–81\%. Two major cleaner production measures based on industrial ecology have been transformed: 1, the production water of pretreatment has been mainly pumped to recirculation sector as supplement; 2, production water of reuse sector has been transferred to desalination sector. Results indicated that if the production water from reuse sector to desalination sector was sufficient, 15,000 tons of pretreatment production water scheduled for desalination sector and cost of 730 United States Dollars have been saved daily. The driving forces for industrial ecology implementation in the industry mainly included the requirements of resource and environment, industrial policy, technical support and enterprise culture. And the present technologies of water utilization in this industry provided scientific guidance for the designs and operation of water utilization for the coal chemical industry.},

Circular economy and IS have been developed for decades and have been successful in China. However, very few studies about the environmental benefit assessment of IS applied by LCA in China have been conducted. In the current article, LCA was used to evaluate the environmental benefits and costs of IS, compared with a no-IS scenario for four environmental impact categories. The results showed that four environmental benefits were avoided by the 11 symbiosis performances, namely, 41.6 thousand TJ of primary energy, 4.47 million t CO2e of greenhouse gasses, 19.7 thousand t SO2e of acidification, and 81.1 t PO43+e of eutrophication. Among these IS performances, the comprehensive utilization of red mud produced the most visible benefit. The results also present that energy conservation was the distinctive feature of IS in China.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an optimization approach to the development of macroscopic networks for water integration within industrial cities. The methodology considers various strategies for industrial wastewater reuse amongst different processing facilities that operate within the city. Two different scenarios for the placement of intermediate water treatment interceptors are considered: (1) on-site ‘decentralized’ water treatment within each plant, and (2) off-site ‘centralized’ water treatment that can be shared amongst a cluster of existing industrial plants. The overall objective is to develop cost-efficient water networks that can attain effective interplant water integration scenarios, whilst considerably reducing freshwater consumption and wastewater discharge where appropriate. The optimization model has been formulated as a Mixed Integer Non-Linear Program (MINLP), and accounts for pressure drops associated with piping across all individual source-interceptor-sink allocations. Additionally, a representation that accounts for constrained water transport was adopted, in which designated corridor regions within an industrial city are utilized for the planning of economical pipeline networks that achieve desirable water allocation strategies. In doing so, shortest routing options were obtained between water sources, sinks, and treatment interceptors, according to a given industrial city layout. A case study that considers various different scenarios in terms of contaminant information and piping connectivity is presented to illustrate the proposed approach.},

Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop and implement the green technologies into the existing facilities, especially in the developing countries. In this study, the role of green supply chains in eco-industrial parks (EIPs) towards a green economy was investigated. The strategies and effective evaluation procedures of the green economy were proposed by assessing the barriers from the perspective of institution, regulation, technology, and finance. In addition, three case studies from iron and steel-making, paper mill and pulping, and petrochemical industries were presented and illustrated for building the green supply chains. For example, in the case of Lin-Hai Industrial Park, a total of 15 efficient green supply chains using waste-to-resources technologies were established by 2012, resulting in an economic benefit of USD 100 million per year. It suggests that the green supply chains should be established to achieve both economic growth and environmental protection. With these successful experiences, building a green supply chain within industrial park should be extensively promoted to make traditional industries around the world being environmentally bearable, economic viable, and social equitable.},

Since industrial ecosystems are complex, nearly decomposable systems, modularity can be used as an approach that can help manage the complexity. In the proposed modularisation approach various businesses act as modules that serve certain functions in the industrial ecosystem. The reason for this is the fact that the development of complex systems from rather stable sub-systems, such as individual businesses, has proved to be reliable and persistent. The article illustrates how the application of such a modular approach affects the business model of a business based on industrial ecosystem thinking. The business model of a biogas producer is discussed as an empirical example of how such a business model also acquires modularity.},

The impact structure analysis identified two statistically significant paths. In the first path, one of three factors regarding “resource circulation system development” had direct significant impacts on EIP development. In the second path, two factors regarding “resource circulation system development” had highly significant impacts on the “cooperative system development”, which, in turn, ultimately had significant impacts on EIP development. This study suggests that there is a need to accomplish EIP development through both “resource circulation system development” and “ecological environment development” associated with “cooperative system development”. Identifying the causal relationship of EIP development factors can help decision-makers focus on strengthening particular influential eco-industrial development strategies to activate EIP development.},

	abstract = {Crude glycerol is the principal by-product of biodiesel industry, accounting for 10 wt\% of biodiesel production. As the production of biodiesel grows, the environmental and sustainable valorization of crude glycerol becomes an imperative task which affects directly the biodiesel production cost. The present study focuses on co-valorization of crude glycerol with conventional and/or renewable resources. The use of pyrolysis and gasification, as waste management practices, closing the loop in energy and agriculture, by using the extracted oil for biodiesel production and the remaining residual biomass for combined heat and power generation, has great potential in a circular economy. The paper is of scientific interest as it investigates the valorization of glycerol waste streams produced from small-scale biodiesel plants, targeting to an effective management solution of the above streams in countries such as Greece, where a chemical biorefinery is not viable due to small availability of glycerol supply. Results have shown that co-valorization of crude glycerol with waste biomass fulfilling the energetic needs of the biodiesel plant within the boundaries of the company, can contribute in decreasing the cost of biodiesel production, while providing a rather short-term solution to the existing environmental problem of waste glycerol.},

However, the vulnerability of these systems is amplified by inadequate management. In this paper, we describe the indicators of stability in an eco-industrial system based on complex network theory to build a cascading failure model for the system. A case from the Qinghai Salt Lake Ecological Industrial Park is introduced to construct the network topological structure and simulate the network cascading failure transmission. We discuss how two types of node enterprises impact the stability of the eco-industrial system. The results show how various node enterprises with different mechanisms affect the systematic stability of the eco-industrial network and how the removal of core node enterprises can lead to greater damage to the network. Managers of eco-industrial systems should focus on structural core enterprises and core industrial chains. In this paper, the managerial implications can provide reliable guidance for stable operations in an eco-industrial system.},

Using the data from 33 developing countries during 1997–2012, we discover the significant promotion effect of PPI investments on the development of financial markets in the dimensions of size and liquidity. Additionally, we confirm the significant mediator effect of financial market size for the positive relationship between PPI investments and financial market liquidity. Both the promotion effect and mediation effect are robust to different control variables and estimation techniques used.},

	abstract = {Most of the old industrial areas are experiencing declining due to their backward equipment, technologies and management, leading to entreprise's bankrupcy, job losses and ecosystem degradation. In order to respond such a challenge, the local governments have made various efforts, such as polluting enterprises' relocation and brownfield redevelopment. It is critical to conduct a scientific assessment for such efforts so that appropriate solutions can be found by considering the local realities. Many evaluation methods, such as emergy analysis, material flow accounting and ecological footprint analysis, have been widely applied. Among them, emergy analysis is a useful policy and planning tool due to its unique nature of linking ecosystem service with different types of input–output flows interacting within a study area. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the overall performance of such a brownfield redevelopment site by observing its evolutional changes. Tiexi old industrial area in Shenyang city of northeast China was selected as the case study area. Years of 2000, 2005 and 2010 were chosen since each year represents a unique feature of its evolution, namely, before and after its redevelopment, as well as its ongoing process. The results show that almost all of the emergy flows were imported from the outside, leading to a lower sustainable development level. Before the relocation and redevelopment program, Tiexi was in the decline stage of economy, the inflow was much lower than those of 2005 and 2010. After the implementation of the relocation and redevelopment program, the flourishing of construction businesses and the drastic changes of urban functions induced higher emergy flows during 2000–2005 and then less emerg flows during 2005–2010 due to the phase-out of relocation. Finally, several policy recommendations were proposed, including preventative and regenerative eco-industrial development, industrial structure change, energy saving and energy structure optimization, and the application of economic instruments, etc.},

	abstract = {Industrial symbiosis (IS) is the process by which by-products are revalorized and exchanged among distinct business entities. The literature suggests that IS can bring financial, social, and environmental benefits to firms and society. Analytical tools have been developed for uncovering IS arrangements and guidelines suggested for designing IS arrangements where they do not yet exist. Despite these suggested benefits and in spite of these tools, few planned IS arrangements have successfully materialized, with notable exceptions in East Asia. Understanding why IS networks emerge and expand or falter requires both macro- and micro-level analysis. Some explanatory factors have been extensively covered in the IS literature, such as the important role of coordinating organizations. But the analysis of enterprise-level actions and strategies as well as the conditions in the external environment that act on the enterprises and the network are not as well examined. The article outlines an analytical framework that draws upon insights from research on cleaner production, corporate social responsibility, diffusion of innovation, and the role of the state in development. The framework is consistent with the view that the evolution of IS networks is characterized by “equifinality.” Different networks may achieve IS as a result of quite different combinations of factors. No general theory of IS success or decline is offered because no such theory can be expected. IS emergence, development, and disruption is approached as a problem of sociohistorical analysis. For such phenomena, analytical frameworks provide a common explanatory starting point, but no predictive power.},

	abstract = {Eco-industrial networks are a concept which has received study for almost 30 years as a strategy for improving economics of production facilities while reducing waste. This study focuses on developing a generalized modeling framework in terms of mixed-integer nonlinear programming of an eco-industrial network. The problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization with the objective to reduce life-cycle emissions and maintaining favourable economics. This model lends itself as a developmental tool to assess environmental and economic feasibility of applying eco-park concepts to new construction projects. In addition, the model is formulated to determine feasible transportation distances between facilities, select the appropriate transportation technologies and is built with the intention of modification toward stochastic import/export pricing. The sensitivity of the network configuration to variances in the weighting factors placed on economics or environmental emissions is discussed and the results from multiple weighting scenarios are presented. These results show that the estimated reductions in cost and emissions are less significant than those from previously published work but are founded upon a more realistic network model. Based on our findings, the cost for the integrated set of facilities is shown to be reduced by 24\% while the emission reduction is observed at 12.7\% for the base scenario examined by the earlier models. These results show less promise than the earlier findings but represent a more realistic assessment of the proposed network. The tools developed by this research present a novel approach to facility planning and policy development for chemical industries. As such, the framework presented herein has the potential to impact facility construction/operation and public policy governing industrial producers; additionally, this research contributes an empirical approach for assessing the practicality of establishing eco-industrial networks and provides an approach for further analyses.},

Although IS is potentially a powerful sustainable business concept for protecting the environment and generating significant revenues, the uptake of IS is less extensive than it could be. Governmental intervention, as manifested through policies, could be influential in shaping IS development. This paper explores policy challenges in implementing IS by matching policies with the challenges to IS practice and figuring out how policies can help overcome these challenges and what are the remaining difficulties to policy-making for IS. The findings suggest that the UK follows a 'bottom-up' dominated approach whereas China follows a 'top-down' dominated approach. It is concluded that, in the UK and China, there are commonalities in policy challenges to IS implementation, and also different difficulties to policy-making in terms of building an IS enabling context in each country.},

	abstract = {Copper concentrate with high copper and sulfur content is the most important raw material in the copper industry. With the scarcity of copper ore resources, resource efficiency must be improved urgently to minimize further losses. This research seeks to elucidate the industrial metabolism of copper and sulfur in the copper smelting process using substance flow analysis and in turn aid in the optimization of production processes. A general model is constructed, and six indices are proposed to quantify and evaluate copper and sulfur metabolisms as well as the economic performance of the system. The Xiangguang Eco-industrial Park (XGEIP), which is a typical sector-specific industrial park in China that mainly caters to enterprises dealing with copper smelting and cathode copper deep processing, is chosen for the case study. On the basis of a five-year in-depth data collection and verification, this research presents the dynamic changes of copper and sulfur metabolism in the XGEIP. The results show that the resource utilization efficiencies of copper and sulfur increased year by year while the environmental impact decreased from 2008 to 2012. In 2012, resource utilization efficiencies of copper and sulfur reached 99.11\% and 98.84\%, respectively. Copper loss occurred mostly in the disposal of slag tailings (0.65\%) while sulfur loss was observed mostly in the waste gas (0.66\%). The environmental factors of copper and sulfur both decreased to 0.014 ton/ton in the system, falling well within the value range of bulk chemicals (i.e., \&lt;1 to 5). Meanwhile, the resource productivity of the copper concentrate underwent rapid growth with the extension of industrial chains during this period. In 2012, the resource productivity reached 6.20 thousand Yuan/ton, which showed an increase of 786\% from that in 2008. These indices indicated that the XGEIP exhibited high productivity and low environmental impact. The results of this work can serve as a reference for decision makers in planning the future of the XGEIP and the development of the copper smelting industry.},

Much of the heat cogenerated from renewables in power plants has been discarded because of the geographical and temporal gaps in heat supply and demand. In this study, we aim to devise an effective industrial symbiosis (IS) for a regional combined heating and power (CHP) plant utilizing local renewable resources. For the actual region of IS, the island of Tanegashima in Japan was adopted, where sugarcane is planted as a base industry. Through a thermodynamic analysis of the energy flows in a sugar mill, it was demonstrated that large amounts of heat were discarded from the sugar mill, even though the quality of heat was high enough for power generation or other energy demand. This is partly because some of the renewables have been regarded as wastes in the production of foods or other high-value-added products. At the same time, scenarios were defined and analyzed on the integrated use of locally available lignocellulosic biomass to increase the operation ratio of an existing bagasse-based CHP system. Through both periods with and without sugar production, additional heat and power can be made available by decreasing the energy loss and through IS.},

There is less focus on how to realize actual exchanges between companies. The purpose of this paper is thus to operationalize current theories and knowledge of such IS barriers in order to provide a guideline on realization of IS projects and hereby make the knowledge of the scientific community applicable in the everyday work of companies. The findings of previous IS research are combined with both research on two companies currently in the process of establishing an IS exchange, as well as practitioners working with facilitation of such exchanges. Lastly, the findings and research are combined to determine what should be the content of a guideline on IS, so that it provides motivated companies with knowledge on potential barriers and opportunities in a way that is directly applicable to their everyday work. The study shows that important barriers for realizing IS-exchanges that can be influenced by companies are mainly related to a lack of resources in the form of money, time, and knowledge, technical issues and collaborative issues. This leads to the recommendation that the contents of a guideline should address information about the concept and benefits of IS, local facilitation programs, if available, and what to be aware of, if there are no facilitation programs or if the companies decide not to take advantage of them.},

	abstract = {Industrial symbiosis is the quintessential characteristic of an eco-industrial park. To divide parks into different types, previous studies mostly focused on qualitative judgments, and failed to use metrics to conduct quantitative research on the internal structural or functional characteristics of a park. To analyze a park’s structural attributes, a range of metrics from network analysis have been applied, but few researchers have compared two or more symbioses using multiple metrics. In this study, we used two metrics (density and network degree centralization) to compare the degrees of completeness and dependence of eight diverse but representative industrial symbiosis networks. Through the combination of the two metrics, we divided the networks into three types: weak completeness, and two forms of strong completeness, namely “anchor tenant” mutualism and “equality-oriented” mutualism. The results showed that the networks with a weak degree of completeness were sparse and had few connections among nodes; for “anchor tenant” mutualism, the degree of completeness was relatively high, but the affiliated members were too dependent on core members; and the members in “equality-oriented” mutualism had equal roles, with diverse and flexible symbiotic paths. These results revealed some of the systems’ internal structure and how different structures influenced the exchanges of materials, energy, and knowledge among members of a system, thereby providing insights into threats that may destabilize the network. Based on this analysis, we provide examples of the advantages and effectiveness of recent improvement projects in a typical Chinese eco-industrial park (Shandong Lubei).},

Drawing on empirical studies in Sweden, this paper develops a theoretical understanding of the roles of LAs in knowledge transfer in regional environmental management networks. It is suggested that LAs, besides initiating networks and being network brokers and managers, can act as ‘knowledge banks’ or ‘knowledge brokers’. As a ‘knowledge bank’, officers in the LA hold the knowledge transferred to companies and engage closely with the companies in small active networks. As ‘knowledge brokers’, LA officers are less active and mainly help companies to get in contact with consultants and technical experts who hold the knowledge needed for developing environmental management in the companies. In all, the roles identified could be seen as more specific approaches to be taken by the LA when playing the overall role of an institutional anchor tenant, facilitating development and management of regional industrial ecosystems.

	abstract = {Bioenergy parks are integrated energy systems developed based on material and energy synergies among bioenergy and auxiliary plants to increase efficiency and reduce carbon emissions. However, the resulting high interdependence between component units results to a vulnerable network upon capacity disruptions (i.e., plant inoperability). Inoperability of one or more plants within a bioenergy park results in a deviation from an initial network configuration because of failure propagation. The consequences of such disruptions depend upon which component units caused the failure. In this work, a probabilistic multi-disruption risk index is developed to measure the net output change of a bioenergy park based on exogenously-defined plant disruption scenarios, whose probabilities are estimated using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). This network index is an important measure of the system’s robustness to an array of probabilistic perturbation scenarios. Such risk-based information can be used for developing risk management measures to reduce network vulnerability through increasing system redundancy and diversity. A bioenergy park case study is presented to demonstrate the computation of the multi-disruption risk index.},

	abstract = {Industrial symbiosis has been identified as a strategy to increase resource efficiency, lower carbon emissions and increase business growth. One type of industrial symbiosis is the innovative use of wastes from one company as a resource for another company. However, empirical understanding of implementing waste-to-resource innovations, and hence how they can be promoted by public and private organisations, is still limited. Therefore this study explored how companies implemented waste-to-resource innovations in the Humber region, UK. Five case studies were conducted with companies that used or supplied a secondary biomass resource for power generation or fuel manufacturing. This article discusses how companies developed relations with biowaste resource suppliers or clients. The results expanded operational understanding of waste-to-resource innovation processes as it revealed companies' activities and their strategic considerations. Comparing the case studies, the social processes through which relations between biowaste resource partners developed were largely similar. However, two different networking strategies were identified. Some companies had to engage new industries and therefore diversified their resource partners during the innovation process, but strived to limit the number of resource partners once the innovation was realised. Conversely, others expanded activities within their network and hence strengthened existing relations during the innovation, but strived to increase the number of resource partners afterwards to manage risky over-dependencies within their supply network. Finally, resource security, economic benefits and policy and regulation were of key importance. To conclude, operational and strategic insights to promote the uptake of waste-to-resource innovations are presented, however, further research is necessary before broad generalizations can be considered.},

Features of industrial symbiosis derived from the example include close geographic proximity among organisations in a system and a ‘short mental distance’ between managers. On the basis of a temporal re-construction and detailed analysis of these arrangements, it is concluded that neither feature is necessarily a prerequisite for successful industrial symbiosis. Bilateral symbiosis is found to be the fundamental transaction with regard to physical transfers of materials and energy. The findings also provide insights on what constitutes waste, the notion of commercial viability and the dichotomy between physical and social symbiosis.},

	abstract = {Eco-industrial parks (EIPs), typically including industrial plants and companies, provide a promising resource conservation strategy that includes opportunities for material exchange between participating plants and minimizes the consumption of resources. However, when the participating plants in the EIP fail to share data, various possible future events are ought to happen in future. In this paper, we present various robust optimization approaches in order to generate alternate solutions for resource conservation in EIPs through water reuse networks that take various future events into consideration. Three different optimization approaches are discussed and solved in this study. In the first optimization approach, the objective function is set to minimize the overall emergy of the EIP. In the second approach, an emergy-based fuzzy optimization model is presented and the objective function of the model is to maximize the overall degree of satisfaction. Finally, a solution method incorporating the lexicographic optimization and augmented ɛ-constraint method is proposed in order to solve the multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem, which simultaneously minimizes the overall freshwater consumption and the regenerated water flow-rate. The resulting model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem taking into consideration two scenarios (EIP reuse network with a regenerator and direct reuse EIP network without a regenerator). The applicability of the proposed optimization approaches is demonstrated by comparison with a literature case study and by comparing the optimal resource conservation results for the two scenarios. The results show that a regeneration unit with a fixed outlet concentration into the base system causes a 15.6\%, 9.8\%, 21.2\%, and 16.2\% reduction in the overall emergy, TAC, freshwater, and wastewater, respectively, in comparison to that of direct reuse.},

However, a successful implementation of an EIP-wide heat integration involves much more than the simple minimization of utility usage. Like any collaborative endeavour involving independent and diverse profit-making enterprises, an EIP-wide heat integration faces several real and practical challenges such as exchanger locations, stream transports over long distances, etc. In this work, we propose a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model (MINLP) for configuring an EIP-wide multi-enterprise heat exchanger network (HEN). We propose a practical and rational strategy that (1) considers all the major capital and operating costs, and utility savings, (2) selects an optimum HEN location with the highest net present value, (3) uses a third-party logistics provider for managing and operating the HEN, and (4) ensures an identical rate of return on investment for all participating enterprises.},

Due to the large number of industrial parks around the world, they are an important and arguably, an appropriate level at which to manage GHG. The question being considered in this paper is whether a multi-disciplinary, muti-dimensional and integrated approach could result in a practical and cost-effective management plan for a carbon neutral eco-industrial park. Taking Debert Air Industrial Park (DAIP), Nova Scotia as an example, a combination of tenant and park strategies, which companies can adopt both individually and collectively in concert with industrial park planners and management are identified and are already being implemented in parks to reduce GHG emissions. The study also involved a survey of business managers. While we agree that some individual strategies such as enhancing renewable energy sources and energy efficiency initiatives will have significant impact, we conclude that a wider mix of strategies including land use planning will be necessary to result in a low carbon, resilient and ecologically sustainable park. Implementing these strategies will be helpful to reduce or offset GHG emissions at an industrial park level and facilitate the transition of industrial parks towards an eco-industrial development in both regenerative and preventative ways through planning, design and management.},

In this paper an innovative method that combines emergy analysis and an IPAT (Human Impact Population Affluence Technology) equation is developed in order to create an integrated framework for uncovering the driving forces on resource consumption in one industrial region. Liaoning province, one of the old heavy industrial bases in China, is selected as the case study region. The main results show that total emergy of Liaoning province increased from 9.25E + 23 sej in 2002 to 1.92E + 24 sej in 2012, with 165\% growth on non-renewable emergy and 250\% growth on imported emergy. Regional emergy/RMB ratio was higher than other developed regions and the average value of China, indicating that this province consumed more local free non-renewable resources to support its own development. The lower ESI (emergy sustainability index) indicates that Liaoning province's sustainability is still weak and far away from sustainable development. IPAT analysis further identifies that rapid economic growth was the main driving force to increase its total emergy use, while technology innovation offset the increase of total emergy use. Policy insights suggest that industrial regions should improve their energy efficiency and optimize their economic and energy structure by applying economic instruments and capacity building efforts.},

	abstract = {There have long been calls from industry for guidance in implementing strategies for sustainable development. The Circular Economy represents the most recent attempt to conceptualize the integration of economic activity and environmental wellbeing in a sustainable way. This set of ideas has been adopted by China as the basis of their economic development (included in both the 11th and the 12th ‘Five Year Plan’), escalating the concept in minds of western policymakers and NGOs. This paper traces the conceptualisations and origins of the Circular Economy, tracing its meanings, and exploring its antecedents in economics and ecology, and discusses how the Circular Economy has been operationalized in business and policy. The paper finds that while the Circular Economy places emphasis on the redesign of processes and cycling of materials, which may contribute to more sustainable business models, it also encapsulates tensions and limitations. These include an absence of the social dimension inherent in sustainable development that limits its ethical dimensions, and some unintended consequences. This leads us to propose a revised definition of the Circular Economy as “an economic model wherein planning, resourcing, procurement, production and reprocessing are designed and managed, as both process and output, to maximize ecosystem functioning and human well-being”.},

The process was analyzed from three aspects: the reduction rate of Cr(VI) in chromium slag, the utilization of effective components and the environmental benefits. We found through experimental research and Sankey diagram analysis that the comprehensive reduction efficiency of Cr(VI) was as high as 98.41\%, and only 1.59\% of Cr(VI) got into the dedusting system and the water quenching system. This showed that the method of recycling COPR in the sintering, iron-making and steel-making process as a replacement for dolomite to reduce Cr(VI) is feasible and effective. Components of COPR such as elemental chromium, magnesium oxide, calcium oxide and ferric oxide were all used effectively, while the rest of COPR ended up in the slag and was then disposed of. The method solved the problem that the COPR need to be landfilled after dry-detoxification due to the formation of a symbiosis chain among chromic chemical plants, steel mills and cement plants. The main factors affecting waste disposal are environmental responsibility and economic cost, and the industrial symbiosis can be used as alternative way of waste disposal to achieve the balance between these factors. Industrial symbiosis can decrease the enterprise cost of waste disposal and fulfill the corporate environmental responsibility, so it can be used as an industrial waste processing method in a certain area to obtain a win–win situation for both economic and environment benefit.},

	abstract = {An industrial symbiosis (IS) network (ISN) is a typical complex system, and resilience is one of its core features. In this article, we investigated the relationship between resilience and interdependency within and between various IS systems. An interdependent network model was proposed based on complex network theory, which preserved the heterogeneity of exchange content and the diversity of symbiosis relationships. We used Yixing Economic and Technological Development Zone (YETDZ) in Jiangsu, China, as the case to construct a material exchange network and three infrastructure-sharing networks. The result implied that increased interdependency contributed to the vulnerability of the system, but it did not necessarily contribute to its resilience. In our model, we identified the significant companies, materials, and infrastructure pipes in YETDZ through centrality metrics and proved the fragility of the system when deliberate changes took place in these components. We also showed the consequence of cascading failures in a single network and distinguished the most vulnerable companies exposed to failures by simulations. The interdependency between material exchange and infrastructure systems were analyzed in two scenarios, and the results implied that more attention should be placed on the key components between different IS systems. In such cases, both managers and planners of ISNs should take proper actions to enhance the adaptability of ISNs, protect significant components, and control cascading failures. The awareness of interdependency should be an indispensable part in future planning and management.},

By examining and addressing the main business needs and sustainability challenges, policy makers, developers and other champions, can promote both business value and social value creation. This paper provides valuable lessons from Devens, Massachusetts, an eco-industrial park established in 1993. Based on 29 interviews with local organizations (30\% participation rate) the study reports on key business needs and sustainability challenges of local organizations and how Devens Enterprise Commission has worked to address these as part of its vision for Sustainable Devens. The study found that access to infrastructure – such as rail, green buildings and roads – was the most important factor for companies to locate to Devens, followed by the lower cost of real estate (59\%) and tax benefits (52\%). Top two sustainability challenges for Devens companies included improving energy efficiency and improving materials efficiency. Eighty six percent of Devens organizations reported partnering with others locally, and 79\% said their organizations could benefit from such partnerships in the future. Companies were most interested in partnering around joint sourcing, infrastructure and knowledge sharing. The study confirmed that local government efforts to develop Devens infrastructure and establish supportive sustainability policies and programs were in line with business needs and a key factor for Devens' success. It confirmed earlier research on the role of industrial ecology as a cluster development policy and the importance of diversity of firms, trust, sustainability policies, and supporting network development as key to creating both business and social value.},

	abstract = {Social Network Analysis (SNA) is a normative tool to analyze the relationship, structure and the
resources liquidity between each actor in a network. To quantitatively measure the industrial
network change in each period on the macroscopic scale and give an objective assessment of the
develop situation of China’s industrial network, the input-output table was used as the data source.
The result shows that industrial network has relatively short average distance, big distance-based
cohesiveness and big Clustering coefficient, which meet the small world character. So that SNA
technique can be used to explore the association and interaction between 42 industry categories.
This also indicates that the resource transfer efficiency of industrial network is high and the
industries connect tightly. China’s industrial network density in 2000 is smaller than it was in 1997,
but after 2000, it was getting bigger and bigger. In centrality analysis, Agriculture industry and
manufacturing industries have high In-degree centrality, Out-degree centrality, Betweenness
centrality and Closeness centrality, which indicate its central position in the network and means that
this industry pulled the upstream industry, promoted the downstream industry and also served as a
bridge in resource circulation. However, some industries like Construction industry (29) only have
high In-degree centrality; the Out-degree centrality and Betweenness centrality is low. This may
illustrate that this industry located in the end of the industrial supply chain and has much smaller
contributions on industrial connection. SNA separated 42 industries into 8 subgroups according to
the relationship tightness, and some closely connections also occurred between some groups. Thus,
the central line of industry network could be found. By this way of analysis, the advantage industry
group can be found; which help this method to be used for making regional development plan.},

	abstract = {As part of the debate on future manufacturing competitiveness, research in Emerging Industries (EIs) has captured the keen attention of academics, industrialists and policy makers. Whilst technology roadmaps provide key perspectives focussed on technology development, effective mechanisms to capture and analyse the development of the industrial supply chain, crucial for commercialisation, remain a challenge. Indeed, these industrial systems are typically complex, and are not readily described by a single viewpoint and in this research we specifically address the need to better understand how supply networks (SNs) that support EIs might be systematically captured and visualised in order to support subsequent analysis of future evolution paths. This paper develops a multi-layered multi-stage mapping approach to explore the characteristics of emerging industry supply networks (EI SNs), and how enabling production technologies and supply chain processes are supported by institutional, industrial and supply network actors. The mapping methodology involves the systematic capture of material transformations, enabling product and process technologies, and the actors, both institutional and industrial that might facilitate industrial development. A key research challenge was to extend traditional methods of SN mapping and value chain analysis that typically adopt a narrow focal firm perspective of a firm’s supply network, to also include key institutional, and other industrial system actors that form part of the wider industrial ecosystem. An industrial ecosystem mapping methodology was therefore developed that integrates and extends value chain analysis with SN configuration mapping, applied to a broader industrial systems context. The methodology is refined through application in selected EI sectors to demonstrate the usability and utility of the approach and its potential for future cross-case comparison studies.},

However, although two different networks can coexist in a large-scale industrial complex, few studies have been conducted to develop an integrated utility supply and H2 supply network (IUHSN) design in a techno-economic optimization framework. In this study, we design an IUHSN which includes a number of utilities (steam, water, and electricity), and H2 sources (manufacturers) and sinks (end customers). Steam methane reforming (SMR) process is used as an intermediate linkage between both networks. To obtain an optimal design of the IUHSN reflecting the reality, we develop a mathematical model which is formulated as multi-period stochastic mixed integer linear programming concerning uncertain raw material prices. This model allows identification of a promising design strategy to minimize total supply cost, because sources and sinks can be connected to each other to transfer unused resources and products.},

	abstract = {Environmental concerns and scarcity of resources encourage decision makers in supply chains to consider alternative production options that include preventing the production of waste streams, and simultaneously reusing and recycling waste materials. Until now, hardly any quantitative modelling approaches exist in literature on closing loops in agri-food supply chains. In contrast to closed-loop studies in discrete parts industry, in agri-food supply chains the value of the final product itself cannot be regained. However, the components used for production such as organic matter or a growing medium, can be recycled. In this paper, the consequences of closing loops in a mushroom supply chain are revealed. We propose a multi-objective mixed integer linear programming model to quantify trade-offs between economic and environmental indicators and explore quantitatively alternative recycling technologies. The model was developed to re-design the logistical structure and close loops in the mushroom supply chain. We found that adopting closing loop technologies in industrial mushroom production has the potential to increase total profitability of the chain by almost 11\% while the environmental performance improves by almost 28\%. We conclude that a comprehensive evaluation of recycling technologies and re-designing logistical structures requires quantitative tools that optimize simultaneously managerial decisions at strategic and tactical level.},

For more than a decade, a handful of national programs and private initiatives have been initiated worldwide to implement industrial ecology into existent or newly built industrial parks. To date, more than hundreds of Eco-Industrial Parks (EIPs) have been established. However, the relationship between the context and the origin of EIP initiatives with its methodology of development and management is still not clearly defined. Therefore, the aim of this article is to contribute to filling this knowledge gap. The return of experiences of 19 EIPs worldwide, based on bibliographical and empirical research through literature review and field interviews, allow the definition of a trend in the creation and the management of EIPs according to the context of implementation. This investigation exposes the exclusive relationships between trigger factors to develop an EIP either economic, environmental or a mix according to the bottom-up, top-down or mixed approach of creation respectively. Moreover, it highlights the association dependence between the natures of the approach with the coordination structure and consequently the influence of the social context and the presence of a certain gap of cohabitation of the two extreme systems, i.e. public and private.},

However, green economy covers a lot of diverse concepts and its links with sustainability are not always clear. In this article, we focus on definitions of green economy and related concepts and an evaluation of these concepts against the criterion of strong and weak sustainability. The article serves three purposes: Firstly, we identify and describe diverse theories, concepts, approaches and tools related to a “green economy”. Among these are the theories of environmental economics and ecological economics, the concepts and approaches of cleaner production, waste hierarchy, bio-economy, industrial ecology, circular economy, nature-based solutions, and dematerialization through product-servicizing, and tools like life cycle assessment, and cost-benefit analysis. Secondly, we develop a framework that shows the capacity of the green economy concepts, approaches and tools to support the transition towards sustainability. Such a framework can serve as a heuristic to embed diverse concepts and approaches into a green economy framework. Thirdly, we briefly discuss green economy concepts with respect to their impact on strong and weak sustainability. Depending on the different concepts, approaches and tools identified in the green economy framework, different degrees of substitutability and trade-offs between environmental and economic benefits are allowed, and more or less structural changes of our modes of living are required. By discussing the notion of green economy and related concepts, approaches and tools we seek to make a contribution to their definitions and relationships as a prerequisite for operationalizing green economy.},

The recycling of solid residues, which are derived in massive quantities from steel production plants, as alternative raw materials towards circular economy, is of increasing importance. In particular, steel dust recovered from EAF gas treatment, contains several oxides and, thus, can be considered as secondary material for substituting clays in traditional brick manufacturing. Possible economic benefits for the energy intensive industrial ceramic sector from energy savings upon firing along with a high potential for environmentally safe management of steel dust should be emphasized. For that purpose, various clay/EAFD mixtures were prepared and mixed with water to form a plastic mass for brick specimen shaping by extrusion. The green specimens were dried, and then fired at different peak temperatures (850, 950 and 1050 °C) in a controlled laboratory chamber furnace for sintering and consolidation. The effect of the by-product content (\%) and of the firing temperature on brick shrinkage, bulk density, water absorption capability, mechanical strength and thermal conductivity was investigated. According to the results, the development of extruded and fired bricks with up to 15 wt.\% recycled steel industry byproduct is feasible without significant variations in their technological properties.},

	abstract = {Forest industry has traditionally been one of the main drivers of the Finnish economy but its output has been mostly low-value, high-volume products, such as paper and board.  The global decrease in paper demand, growing interest in renewable materials to replace fossil-based materials and the increased understanding of wood biomass chemistry have spurred totally new aspirations to utilize cellulose, the main component of plants and the most abundant organic polymer on Earth.


This research is written as part of the project Design Driven Value Chains in the World of Cellulose (DWoC), a strategic initiative aiming to make Finland the birthplace of branded, value-added cellulose products and new business concepts built on them. The project is conducted as collaboration of several institutions and funded on large part by The Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation (Tekes). One of the core goals of DWoC is the development, piloting and fostering of appropriate business models and emerging business ecosystem. However, most of the novel utilization areas of cellulose are still quite far from commercialization.


Research applies the theory of business ecosystem to examine the possibilities to take novel, value-added, design-driven application areas of cellulose to markets. Business ecosystem is a concept developed in 1990s to describe the interconnectedness of companies and the resulting dynamics. In the core of the concept is co-evolution, which occurs between companies in business ecosystem in a same way as between organisms in natural ecosystem. Business ecosystem has been used extensively to describe the dynamics of IT industry. This research brings the ecosystem discourse to forest-based industry.


Also many other ecosystem concepts have been developed in literature, such as innovation ecosystem, industrial ecosystem and entrepreneurship ecosystem. All these, along with the closely related concept cluster are discussed in the literature review part. Properties, structure and lifecycle of business ecosystem are discussed, as well as the managerial challenges of being a part of business ecosystem.


Research was conducted as an exploratory case study. Data collection methods used were in-depth, semi-structured interviews of five professional persons. All these persons had a long background of working with forest-based products and novel utilization areas of cellulose in different roles, either in industry or academic research.


Interviews provided rich insight on what would be the outlook of the prospective business ecosystem, in which new applications of cellulose are effectively transferred from research to markets. First, the business ecosystem is an emergent structure by nature and cannot be born with purposeful construction. Second, the prospective business ecosystem would consist mostly of already existing actors, reinforced with some totally new actors. Third, there are many obstacles for the emergence of the ecosystem, such as the risk-aversiveness of traditional forest corporations and lack of scalable business models. Fourth, diffusion of innovation-related information among actors should be couraged in order to enhance the technology transfer.},

	abstract = {In recent decades, our cities are increasingly expected to become more sustainable urban forms, with many added determinants. A multitude of city concepts has therefore been contrived. The most time-honored and prominent concept is the “sustainable city,” which is depicted as a model urban form and thereafter more city concepts have come into being. However, it is not clear for all the concepts, for instance, “eco-cities,” “smart city,” “sustainable city,” and “resilient city,” what are the underpinning building blocks within each concept and how these concepts correlate with each other. This bibliometric study organizes this in conducting a descriptive summary, a clustering analysis, and multidimensional scaling of major city concepts, by establishing a co-word matrix of high-frequency keywords occurring in the Science Citations Index (SCI) and Social Science Citations Index (SSCI) databases. In addition to summarizing the evolution of these concepts, it analyzes the composition of each city concept and the core issues addressed by each city type. Also investigated are the correlations between the city concepts with a statistical analysis of the clusters of literature in one concept that overlap or connect to other clusters in another. From this, it is shown that, under the two umbrella terms of “sustainable city” and “smart city,” the “? -city” literature has developed in a variety of distinctive ways.},

This framework has been applied to a case study to assess options for the establishment of a local energy production system that involves a heathland ecosystem, bioenergy production, and wastewater treatment. We found that the framework is useful to analyze the two-way interactions between these components in order to obtain insight into the behavior and performance of the bioenergy production system.

Because of their properties, nonwoven geotextiles have many advantages in railways reinforcement, slopes stabilization, erosion control, drainage, filtration, paving roads, crops coverings, etc. The nonwoven geotextiles were obtained from three fibrous blends based on recovered fibers (PES and PAN) and fibers at first usage (PP) in different ratios. All experimental variants were processed on the same manufacturing line with the same technological parameters. There were tested the main physical and mechanical parameters and it was applied single factor ANOVA method for thickness, bulk density, air permeability and static puncture strength. The conclusion is that adding PP fibers in the blends represents a very important factor for geotextiles characteristics but it possible to decrease the ratio from economical reasons and still maintain a high quality level of nonwovens.},

	url = {http://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/337156},
	abstract = {Disposable plastic packaging contributes to many problems. These include the depletion of resources, litter pollution of soil and sea and micro plastics coming into the food chain. This paper will contend that a circular economy (CE) could address these and other problems by relieving the pressures on natural resources and reducing the waste problem. The Netherlands has a relatively well functioning waste infrastructure, though has not yet reached a closed loop. While CE is not a new subject, and waste management has been extensively studied over the years, it has mostly been done on the output side and many scattered approaches to a CE exist. This explorative research studies the waste problem from redesigning of the supply chain perspective and combines the many scattered approaches. Moreover, it addresses the knowledge gap of the influence of awareness of the producing industry of the need for a CE. From these problems the research question is formulated: To what extent are the main stakeholders in the Dutch plastic food packaging supply chain exhibiting the behavioral alternatives attributing to a circular economy, and which drivers are influential in overcoming the barriers towards a circular economy from an institutional theory perspective? This will be studied through an embedded case study approach on the consecutive actors in the Dutch food packaging supply chain. Based on a literature study, the economic actors of the chain are interviewed through a semi-structured interview. Consumer behavior is studied in a literature study, and the relevant legislation is identified through desk research. Built on the extended conceptual model of sociological institutional theory by Zhu and Geng (2013), the drivers and barriers for the behavioral alternatives for a CE are explored. Based on the interviews and consumer literature study it can be concluded that many improvements need to be made before a CE can be accomplished. Costs, hindering regulations and policies, lacking technology and simple refusal to change are the most encountered barriers. However, these barriers can be overcome. The most progressive actors are often normatively influenced, and the actors who are both normatively and coercively driven encounter fewer barriers. This paper will demonstrate the importance of these drivers to overcome the barriers and show that mimetic driven actors do not usually undertake new initiatives. Hence, normative and coercive drivers seem to be most influential means to overcome the barriers to a CE.},

	abstract = {Scientists, government officials, firms, and other actors around the world are discussing ways to create a sustainable economic system. One often heard option is the circular economy. This is based on the idea that by cycling materials continuously, waste can be prevented and the pressure on the natural system reduced. The circular economy also requires becoming sustainable in order to stay within the natural boundaries of the planet. Currently, the main tool to assess the environmental impacts of products throughout their lifespan is the lifecycle assessment or LCA. Recent developments within the LCA methodology have increased its scope and ambition to also quantify economic and social impacts. Because the LCA methodology assesses lifecycles, and the circular economy thinks in lifecycles, LCA seems a logical choice to support a transition towards a circular economy. However, the major problem with LCA is the fact that it is a highly flexible tool resulting in conflicting and inaccurate results. By recreating the material and socio-economic principles of the circular economy, this research created a transition model of four phases of circular economic development. When the flexibility of the LCA methodology was identified and categorised in various levels of flexibility, it was possible to compare LCA flexibility to the circular economic principles in the various development phases. This provided the ability to identify the maximum acceptable LCA flexibility in each phase of circular economic development if LCA was to continue supporting the circular economy. This resulted in the insight that although the LCA methodology can currently play a positive role in the development of a circular economy, when the economy transitions towards circularity it becomes increasingly necessary to reduce the flexibility in LCA. This is vital because throughout the development of a circular economy actors become increasingly interconnected and must stay within the planet’s natural boundaries. Consequently, they need to be able to rely on the quality and precision of LCA studies for their decisions. Therefore, this research concludes that the LCA methodology can play a positive role in the development of a circular economy, but needs to be regularly updated in order to ensure that the maximum allowed flexibility remains acceptable for the phase of circular economy development society finds itself in.},

	abstract = {Potential local solutions for the provisioning of food, like urban agriculture (UA), become intriguing
when looking at food against the background of a growing urban world population, globalised food
structures, environmental degradation and an increasing scarcity of resources like water, energy and
land. By focusing on UA within a vertical-, controlled- and resource-integrated setting, this research
has chosen to focus on a newly emerging form of UA that is rather large-scale, high-tech and has the
potential to trigger structural change. Its hypothesised potential to challenge existing food structures
has resulted in a theoretical approach based on the multi-level-perspective (MLP) on socio-technical
transitions, specifying a niche-, regime- and landscape-level, while furthermore building on concepts
of governance. Firstly, potential transition drivers have been classified in landscape developments
and niche pressures. Secondly, the capacity of an urban system to govern or ‘scale-up’ such a
transition process has been analysed and expressed in a degree of governance capacity on the
regime-level. By drafting and applying an analytical framework, this research has been able to
analyse transition drivers and the scale-up potential in two specific case studies of vertical-,
controlled- and resource-integrated-UA. By conducting two in-depth analyses through desk research
and semi-structured-interviews in the urban context of Linköping and Singapore, this research has
been able to gain more insights into the world’s first initiatives of vertical-, controlled- and resourceintegrated-
UA. In short, the main conclusions show that both niches rest upon a strong knowledge
foundation and expertise. Despite the underexposed role of stressful landscape developments in
theory, they seem of essence in the articulation of expectation and visions by niche actors. They
furthermore seem to play a major role in the degree of awareness, willingness and power that
determine the governance capacity of a regime. Vertical-, controlled- and resource-integrated-UA
seems to be strongly driven by the private sector, in which financial investments and economic
viability are currently playing crucial roles. Generally, this research has aimed to be of scientific
relevance by addressing knowledge gaps in transition theories when it comes to understanding
drivers of change and the analytical capacity for empirical validation, furthermore touching upon the
underexposed role of agency or governance. It has been able to provide an operationalisation of the
landscape-, regime- and niche-level, including independent variables, hypotheses, indicators and
corresponding research methods. By turning descriptive transition and governance concepts into a
more analytical tool for assessment, this research has furthermore been able to provide context specific
feedback and lessons for vertical-, controlled- and resource-integrated UA.},

	title = {An exergy based method for resource accounting in factories},
	url = {https://www.dora.dmu.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/2086/12488},
	abstract = {In the current global climate of declining fossil fuel reserves and due to the impact of industry on the natural environment, industrial sustainability is becoming ever more important. However, sustainability is quite a vague concept for many, and there are a range of interpretations of the word. If the resource efficiency of a factory is taken as a measure of its sustainability, then the concept becomes better defined and quantifiable. In order to analyse the resource efficiency of a factory and suggest improvements, all flows through the manufacturing system need to be modelled. However the factory is a complex environment, there is a wide variation in the quality levels of energy as well as the composition of material flows in the system. The research presented in this thesis shows how the thermodynamics-based concept of ‘exergy’ can be used to quantify the resource efficiency of a factory. The factory is considered an ‘integrated system’, meaning it is composed of the building and the production processes, both interacting with each other. This is supported by three case studies in different industries that demonstrate the practical application of the approach. A review of literature identified that it was appropriate to develop a novel approach that combined exergy analysis with the integrated view of the factory. Such an approach would allow a ‘holistic’ assessment of resource efficiency for different technology options possibly employable. The development of the approach and its illustration through practical case studies is the main contribution of the work presented. Three case studies, when viewed together, illustrate all aspects of the novel exergy based resource accounting approach. The first case study is that of an engine production line, in which the resource efficiency of this part of the factory is analysed for different energy system options relating to heating ventilation and air conditioning. Firstly, the baseline is compared with the use of a solar photovoltaic array to generate electricity, and then a heat recovery unit is considered. Finally, both of these options were used together, and here it is found that the non-renewable exergy supply and exergy destruction are reduced by 51.6\% and 49.2\% respectively. The second case study is that of a jaggery (a sugar substitute) production line. The exergy efficiency of the process is calculated based on varying the operating temperature of the jaggery furnace. The case study describes the modelling of al flows through the jaggery process in terms of exergy. Since this is the first example of an exergy analysis of a jaggery process, it can be considered a minor contribution of the work. An imaginary secondary process that could utilize the waste heat from the jaggery process is considered in order to
illustrate the application of the approach to industrial symbiosis. The non-renewable exergy supply and exergy destruction are determined for the baseline and the alternative option. The goal of this case study is not to present a thermally optimized design; rather it illustrates how the exergy concept can be used to assess the impact of changes to individual process operations on the overall efficiency in industrial symbiosis. When considering natural resource consumption in manufacturing, accounting for clean water consumption is increasingly important. Therefore, a holistic methodology for resource accounting in factories must be able to account for water efficiency as well. The third case study is that of a food production facility where the water supply and effluent are modelled in terms of exergy. A review of relevant literature shows that previously, the exergy content of only natural water bodies and urban wastewater had been quantified. To the author’s knowledge, this is the first example of applying this methodology of modelling water flows in a manufacturing context. The results show that due to a high amount of organic content in food process effluent, there is significant recoverable exergy in it. Therefore, a hypothetical water treatment process was assumed to estimate the possible savings in exergy consumption. The results show that at least a net 4.1\% savings in terms of exergy could be possible if anaerobic digestion water treatment was employed. This result can be significant for the UK since the food sector forms a significant portion of the industry in the country. Towards the end of the thesis, a qualitative study is also presented that aims to evaluate the practical utility of the approach for the industry. A mixed method approach was used to acquire data from experts in the field and analyse their responses. The exergy based resource accounting method developed in this thesis was first presented to them before acquiring the responses. A unanimous view emerged that the developed exergy based factory resource accounting methodology has good potential to benefit industrial sustainability. However, they also agreed that exergy was too complex a concept to be currently widely applied in practice. To this effect, measures that could help overcome this barrier to its practical application were presented which form part of future work.},

	abstract = {Biologically Inspired Design (Biomimicry) and Industrial Ecology both look to natural systems to enhance the sustainability and performance of engineered products, systems and industries. Bio-inspired design (BID) traditionally has operated on a unit operation and single product level. In contrast, this paper describes how principles of network organization derived from analysis of ecosystem properties can be applied to industrial system networks. Specifically, this paper examines the applicability of particular food web matrix properties as design rules for economically and biologically sustainable industrial networks, using an optimization model developed for a carpet recycling network. Carpet recycling network designs based on traditional cost and emissions based optimization are compared to designs obtained using optimizations based solely on ecological food web metrics. The analysis suggests that networks optimized using food web metrics also were superior from a traditional cost and emissions perspective; correlations between optimization using ecological metrics and traditional optimization ranged generally from 0.70 to 0.96, with flow-based metrics being superior to structural parameters. Four structural food parameters provided correlations nearly the same as that obtained using all structural parameters, but individual structural parameters provided much less satisfactory correlations. The analysis indicates that bio-inspired design principles from ecosystems can lead to both environmentally and economically sustainable industrial resource networks, and represent guidelines for designing sustainable industry networks.},

	abstract = {Intensive energy consumption and high pollution emissions in the iron and steel industry have caused problems to the energy system, in the economy, and in the environment. Iron and steel industrial network as an example of energy conservation and emissions reduction, require better analysis and assessment. The present study comprehensively assesses an iron and steel industrial network and its environmental performance with respect to exergy, energy and CO2 emissions. The results show that the sinter strand needs to be greatly improved and the wet quenching process needs to be completely redesigned. The overall exergy efficiency and energy efficiency can be improved by adopting industrial symbiosis (IS) measures. We found that adjusting the energy structure to use renewable energy and recycling solid waste can greatly reduce CO2 emissions. Moreover, the maximum exergy losses occurred in the blast furnace with the maximum CO2 emissions. The iron making plant exerted a strong effect on the environment based on the equivalent CO2 emission potentials. Many performance indicators of the entire industrial network were also examined in this work. It can be seen that integrated evaluation of energy and CO2 emissions with exergy is necessary to help to mitigate adverse environmental impacts and more effectively fulfill the goals for energy conservation and emissions reduction.},

	abstract = {Design has been recognised in the literature as a catalyst to move away from the traditional model of take-make-dispose to achieve a more restorative, regenerative and circular economy. As such, for a circular economy to thrive, products need to be designed for closed loops, as well as be adapted to generate revenues. This should not only be at the point of purchase, but also during use, and be supported by low-cost return chains and reprocessing structures, as well as effective policy and regulation. To date, most academic and grey literature on the circular economy has focused primarily on the development of new business models, with some of the latter studies addressing design strategies for a circular economy, specifically in the area of resource cycles and design for product life extension. However, these studies primarily consider a limited spectrum of the technical and biological cycles where materials are recovered and restored and nutrients (e.g., materials, energy, water) are regenerated. This provides little guidance or clarity for designers wishing to design for new circular business models in practice. As such, this paper aims to address this gap by systematically analysing previous literature on Design for Sustainability (DfX) (e.g., design for resource conservation, design for slowing resource loops and whole systems design) and links these approaches to the current literature on circular business models. A conceptual framework is developed for circular economy design strategies. From this conceptual framework, recommendations are made to enable designers to fully consider the holistic implications for design within a circular economy.},

	abstract = {Nowadays industrial parks have played a massive role in promoting regional economic development. However, due to intensive industrial activities and enormous energy consumption, industrial parks have become the main areas for pollution emissions. China has carried out the National Demonstration Eco-industrial Parks program to solve such challenges. Industrial symbiosis is the kernel of industrial ecological construction. It aims at promoting several companies to gather in a same geographical site to share services, utility, and by-products in order to decrease environmental impacts of their industrial activities. However how to quantify the impact of industrial symbiosis on improving the sustainability of an industrial park is rarely studied. This study proposed an emergy analysis to conduct an assessment on Hefei economic and technological development area to quantify the performance of industrial symbiosis. Comparing with conventional evaluation methods, emergy analysis can reflect the real contribution of local ecosystem by focusing on nature's free investment, not only the economic value or the resources supplied to the industrial system. Research results show that industrial symbiosis operations improve the study area's sustainable development ability by 33\%. Specifically, non-renewable inputs, imported resource inputs, and associated services could be saved by 99.71\%, 25.64\%, and 9.82\%, and the ratio of the money saving to the total gross domestic product of the industrial park would be 29.71\%. By examining industrial symbiosis practices in detail within the system, this paper can describe the process of the industrial symbiosis and how these industrial symbiosis practices influence the overall performance of the industrial park. This study indicates that industrial symbiosis could effectively reduce raw materials and energy consumption and improve the overall sustainability, which can help policy-makers make decisions.},

	abstract = {Due to their sheer size and complexity, megacities are extreme examples in which both negative and positive aspects of urbanization co-exist and are amplified. Especially in emerging countries they are becoming the dominant paradigm of the future urbanization, representing a sustainability challenge both from the point of view of energy and resource consumption, and from the point of view of climate change adaptation and mitigation.

In this paper we compare the energy metabolism in 27 of the world’s megacities including details of mobile and stationary energy consumption patterns, fuels used, as well as end-use patterns and electricity generation mix.

Our results show that per capita total energy consumption scales with urban population density according to a power law characterized by the universal −3/4 scaling, pointing out that compact cities are more energy efficient with respect to dispersed cities.

By comparing energy sources and sectoral end use, also focusing on electricity use and generation source, we found a significant regionalization of energy metabolism, and we discuss the implication for resilience, infrastructure planning, GHG emissions, and policies for infrastructure decarbonization. The comparison of the energy metabolism can lead to a more appropriate management of energy use patterns and electricity generation mix in megacities, giving insights on strategies to improve urban energy efficiency and reducing environmental pressure of megacities.},

In the specific case of industrial symbiosis indicators, this task is particularly challenging owing to the inherent difficulty in obtaining series of real data of consequence for the small number of EIPs and large number of organizations. Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) emerges as a technique to support EIP simulations. This work endorses the use of the ABM technique to validate indicators of industrial symbiosis through the construction of a model that simulates an EIP, which is then evaluated by applying three indicators: the Industrial Symbiosis Indicator (ISI) of Felicio et al. (2016) and the Eco-Connectance and By-product and Waste Recycling Rate indicators of Tiejun (2010). The model was able to calculate the three indicators and identify conditions where their performances are equal or with misleading information regarding industrial symbiosis evolution. It supports the validation of industrial symbiosis indicators and demonstrates that the indicator by Felicio et al. (2016) is more robust for turbulent periods of industrial ecosystem environments.},

	abstract = {The eco-industrial park (EIP), as a new industrial park combining the concept of circular economy and industrial ecology principles of construction, has not only become an effective way to achieve sustainable development, improving energy efficiency and the ecological environment quality in many countries, but has also become an important carrier of implementing science-based, adjusting the industrial structure, accelerating the transformation, and upgrading and constructing ecological civilization in China. China began construction of eco-industrial demonstration park pilots in 1999, and subsequently has actively carried out the practice of building eco-industrial parks nationwide. Although the EIPs have made great progress in terms of planning and construction, and achieved some success in improving energy efficiency, reducing environmental pollution, and improving environmental quality, there are many problems in the development process that restrict the stable operation and coordinated development and continuous improvement of the park, such as weak ecological relevance between enterprises, low resources and energy output rate, imperfect organizational structure, unclear construction goals, and insufficient technical innovation. The causes of these problems are mainly due to the government agencies and park management department not paying enough attention to the coordinated development degree of EIPs, lacking a practicable index system and assessment method for assessing the degree of sustainable development and comprehensive development level, which result in their being unable to fully grasp the operational state of the park and also unable to formulate a highly appropriate development strategy. Therefore this chapter, based on the systematic study of the development of EIPs both domestic and abroad, is focused on the theory and methods of constructing the index system of EIPs, establishing the degree of coordination and comprehensive development level index system, and evaluation methods of sector-integrated eco-industrial parks (SIEIPs). Specific research includes the following aspects: (1) reviewing the status of domestic and foreign research and development of EIPs, and at the same time, overviewing several relevant theories and methods of construction of an EIP evaluation index system, including: eco-efficiency, flow analysis, and index systems; (2) drawing on the ideas of the analytic hierarchy process and taking the coordinated development degree and the comprehensive development level as the overall evaluation goal of SIEIPs, from economic development, resource utilization, environmental protection, ecological civilization, park management, and social progress, six subsystems proceeding to consider the current situation, construction effect, stability of development, sustainability and coordination of SIEIP development, and then using frequency statistics and expert consulting methods to select several evaluation indexes initially, further superimposed on the primary indicators analyzed, to screen and ultimately fix the evaluation index system of SIEIPs; (3) applying a multilevel extension comprehensive evaluation method to build a model of coordinated development degree and integrated development level of the SIEIPs, and using this model to evaluate a typical eco-industrial park. The results show that typical EIPs will have to make more effort regarding the stable and sustainable development of circular economy status. In addition, the evaluation results are factor analyzed, proposing strategies and measures for improvement.},

	abstract = {In the last decade, Malaysia has experienced exceptional growth, progressing from primarily agriculture-based to a more developed manufacturing-based industrial economy. The natural rubber industry has been an important sector for Malaysia's economic development, contributing RM33.7 billion (USD101.1billion) or 4.69\% of the country's Gross Domestic Profit (GDP) in 2013. This paper aims to apply the industrial symbiosis (IS) concept to the proposed Rubber City bilateral industrial development in Kedah, Malaysia. The concept of IS can be considered a strategic tool to enhance environmental and socio-economic sustainability of rubber industry. This paper involves stakeholder analysis of IS to identify strategic priorities and opportunities for the Rubber City initiative. The IS framework focuses on three main natural rubber downstream products: natural rubber blocks, tyres, and gloves; and identifies synergies in resource cycles and waste management using Materials Flow Analysis (MFA) and the Input-Output (IO) data based on previous Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) data for each of the three natural rubber products. Based on this case study, we identified ten principal synergies which include five potential IS industries integrated within the RC conceptual framework. Stakeholder surveys of natural rubber processors and other actors (such as government agencies) were conducted in Malaysia to identify barriers and enabling factors for IS implementation in the Rubber City. The outcomes of this study will be used as basis for integrated strategic development plan and implementation approach towards a sustainable Rubber City development in Malaysia.},

	abstract = {This article reveals the main challenges that occur in the context of Central and Eastern European countries and presents a theoretical framework that reflects the ecosystem-based approach to the bottom-up emergence of industrial ecosystems.  The framework that adapts the approach of complexity theory was created by analysing success stories of the (re)emergence and development of self-organising industrial systems.  Based on the analysis of those stories, the integrated stages of emergence and development were defined.  The framework presented in this article allows researchers and practioners to identify the main obstacles that hinder the development of industrial ecosystems in any stage.  In addition, this framework facilitates the formulation of strategies behind the successful regional industrial systems, including the context of Central and Eastern European countries.},

	abstract = {Recently several agro-industrial parks have been developed as applications of industrial ecology to agriculture, aiming at improved sustainability performance. Grounded in industrial ecology and the literature on inter-organizational networks, this study explores the social structure of sustainability oriented collaborations in agro-industrial parks. Empirical data from sixty four organizations in three Dutch agro-industrial parks are analyzed at network and at organizational level. At network level, the results show that network decentralization comes along with a high density of formal ties. At organizational level, the results show that the organizations in agro-industrial parks are more efficiently positioned (i.e. more positively perceive sustainability performance) in the network of formal ties if they can build ties with other organizations via a small number of intermediary partners (i.e. high closeness centrality) instead of having a large number of direct ties. A decentralized structure of formal ties in combination with sparse interdependency has a relatively positive influence on sustainability improvement perceptions. In conclusion, network decentralization is important for the organizations that avoid dependency on one (or a small number of) central and/or powerful actor(s). The preferable decentralized formal ties and sparse interdependencies were (quantitatively and qualitatively) most evident in the self-organized parks, confirming that, for the sake of sustainability improvements, a self-organized agro-industrial park is preferable to a planned park. With regard to the theoretical contribution, this study opened up a new area of research for waste streams exchanges among co-located heterogeneous companies by examining them as inter-organizational networks in agro-industrial parks. With regard to the practical implications, the study suggests that organizations seeking advanced environmental performance should build ties by optimizing the number of intermediary partners.},

We need to arrive at a reconciliation between the desire for economic and social development on the one hand, and environmental protection on the other. The concepts of industrial ecology and industrial symbiosis are providing viable solutions to economic growth without sacrificing environmental quality. The implementation of industrial symbiosis in the economy represents an innovative method to promote green economy and to create a new culture of economic growth. The chapter will present the concepts of industrial ecology and industrial symbiosis in the context of eco-innovation, the advantages and limitations in their implementation, and some significant case studies with positive results in promoting green growth through industrial symbiosis.},

	abstract = {Replacing virgin materials with waste materials, a practice known as Industrial Symbiosis (IS), has been identified as a key strategy for closing material loops. This article adopts a critical view on geographic proximity and external coordinators – two key enablers of IS. By ‘uncovering’ a case where both enablers are absent, this study seeks to explore firm-level challenges of IS. We adopt an exploratory case study approach at a cement manufacturer who engages in cross-border IS without the support of external coordinators. Our research presents insights into two key areas of IS: 1) setting-up the initial IS exchange and 2) improving the performance of existing IS exchanges. Moreover, our research provides initial insights into the underlying nature of the related firm-level challenges and explores how internal coordination between manufacturing and purchasing may or may not act as a substitute for geographic proximity and external coordinators. In doing so, our insights into firm-level challenges of long-distance IS exchanges contribute to closing global material loops by increasing the number of potential circular pathways.},
