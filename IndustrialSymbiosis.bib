Treatment of the waste is expensive, and cities face challenges on waste disposal sites. A sustainable solution would be to realize industrial symbioses. The typical approach is to design and develop industrial parks each of which is aimed to be an industrial symbiosis. This approach is proven by successful cases, but is constrained by land scarce cities as well as the limited types and scales of the companies that can be included in an industrial park. The paper proposes a big data analytics approach to realize industrial symbioses among the industries in a city's close proximity. The waste streams and resource requirements of existing companies are identified and matched with resources needs directly or indirectly through conversion processes. The viability, critical elements and technical challenges of the approach are discussed.},

By constructing industrial ecosystems, Nanning Sugar Co., Ltd. in China, has achieved the successful transition from a traditional corporation to a sustainable corporation, or rather, a circular corporation. This study expounds on its whole transition course to a circular complex in the past decade, in which four factors are essential to making this symbiosis achievable: rational production structures; raw materials advantages; technical supports and correct diversification. The corporation is in charge of almost all the aspects of its affiliated companies and the management mode, in particular, differing from that of industrial symbiosis systems in Kalundborg, is considered another potential factor contributing to the corporate success. The transition mode in question is hoped to point to a feasible development path for similar corporations.},

	abstract = {Abstract Industry and fossil fuel combustion are the main sources for urban carbon emissions. Most studies focus on energy consumption emission reduction and energy efficiency improvement. Material saving is also important for carbon emission reduction from a lifecycle perspective. IS (Industrial symbiosis) and UrS (urban symbiosis) have been effective since both of them encourage byproduct exchange. However, quantitative carbon emission reduction evaluation on applying them is still lacking. Consequently, the purpose of this paper is to fill such a gap through a case study in Kawasaki Eco-town, Japan. A hybrid LCA model was employed to evaluate to the lifecycle carbon footprint. The results show that lifecycle carbon footprints with and without IS and UrS were 26.66 Mt CO2e and 30.92 Mt CO2e, respectively. The carbon emission efficiency was improved by 13.77\% with the implementation of IS and UrS. The carbon emission reduction was mainly from “iron \& steel” industry, cement industry and “paper making” industry, with figures of 2.76 Mt CO2e, 1.16 Mt CO2e and 0.34 Mt CO2e, respectively. Reuse of scrape steel, blast furnace slag and waste paper are all effective measures for promoting carbon emission reductions. Finally, policy implications on how to further promote IS and UrS are presented.},

	abstract = {The UK Sustainable Development Strategy requires that society strive to make prudent use of natural resources so as to protect the environment and maintain high and stable levels of economic growth and employment. The Waste Strategy for England and Wales emphasises the need to reduce the amount of waste produced through the adoption of waste minimisation methodology. Waste minimisation clubs have been a key element in the UK programme to introduce more sustainable practice into industry and commerce. Northamptonshire, a county in the East Midlands of England, has benefited from 20 waste minimisation/resource efficiency projects, within a county programme, that have run between 1997 and 2004. This is the largest number in any county in England. This has been possible because of the formation of a large and inclusive partnership that contains all the key Local and Regional players. Performance Indicators have been developed to direct the county programme as it strives to introduce more sustainable waste management practice. The Northamptonshire model has led to a catalysed uptake of sustainable waste management practice in some 574 companies, some 13.4\% of participating companies in England in same period, thereby contributing to the maintenance of stable levels of economic activity. However, an inherent limit has been reached with waste minimisation club provision. Future provision for resource efficiency must include the movement towards Industrial Symbiosis (IS) and ultimately Industrial Ecology (IE). The radical shift towards IS and IE will occur as a response to the increased quantification of the resource flows, in a given UK economic area, and the deeper understanding of the diversity and complexity of the systems.

	abstract = {Abstract Industrial synergies – be they, the single by-product exchanges between two companies or the comprehensive industrial symbiosis networks involving numerous industrial synergies – have been recognized for their potential to improve industrial resource efficiency and provide simultaneous economic benefits. With increasing research on maximizing the implementation of industrial symbiosis initiatives per se, the notion of quality of these implemented exchanges has been disregarded. Nevertheless the quality and consideration of whole production life cycle impacts of industrial symbiosis initiatives are important to ensure harmonic and sustainable development. To develop and promote a strategy for advancement of new and qualitative industrial synergies the analysis and evaluation of existing examples of collaboration is necessary. To provide a means for evaluation and comparison of the quality of industrial synergies, a qualitative evaluation method is developed. An illustration of the evaluation method is presented through two case studies of industrial synergies identified in the brewery industry and the wood processing industry in Latvia. The results of these case studies provide valuable information for decision makers in Latvia and industrial symbiosis practitioners worldwide. Case study results show that only few of the considered self-organized industrial synergies are beneficial regarding all three – environmental quality, economic quality and geographic proximity – evaluation categories. This leads to the conclusion that these three aspects create a three-layer filter for development of qualitative industrial synergies and the quality of each category should be considered before the planning stage of such collaborations.},

	abstract = {Abstract In the post-crisis approach to welfare states, the role of authorities as providers of welfare becomes more pronounced. As local authorities across the European Union are confronted with new and often unfavourable financing mechanisms, the performance and management of mandatory and voluntary duties must be reconsidered. As sustainable development and a more frugal management of public funds becomes more important, local authorities need to find new and innovative ways to mitigate their expenditures. The authors anticipate that local authorities will be interested in a more active participation in industrial ecological systems with advantages for sustainability. The fundamental question is: how could the process of finding potential partners for industrial ecological partnerships between businesses, and between businesses and the authority be facilitated? The authors review the concept of industrial ecology and its potential benefits; and also highlight the possible connection points between local governments and a business cluster, through an overview of mandatory and voluntary duties and responsibilities local governments must perform. The main answer to the research question is the framework of a novel decision support system (DSS) to facilitate the establishment of new connections and rationalise existing ones in pursuit of greater efficiency at reduced costs, whilst also promoting the aims of sustainable development. Finally, the authors consider the wider regional economic consequences of the DSS in the attractiveness of the eco-industrial cluster to new entrants, through the exploration of a set of plausible scenarios will be explored.},

	abstract = {Abstract An Eco-Industrial Park (EIP) is composed of a number of Industrial Symbiosis (IS) instances, which allow energy/material exchanges among the different industrial enterprises (Individual Actors, IA) therein. By so doing, IA's economic and environmental performances can be improved. Despite recent methodological advancements, the existing approaches to \{EIP\} design optimization are still suffering from several major problems: (i) dominance of the global \{EIP\} optimum over the local \{IA\} optimum, (ii) limited number of optimization objectives falling into the categories of economic and environmental objectives and (iii) \{EIP\} optimization performed without considering possible operational uncertainties. In addition, the adoption of the bio-inspired concept of \{IS\} makes \{EIP\} evolve from classical engineered systems towards complex engineered systems, with associated static and dynamic complexity characteristics. To highlight and understand the complexity features of EIP, in this paper we present them as intelligent networks for multiple energy and material exchanges, drawing a parallel with another typical complex system, that of the electric power network, in its modern Smart Grid (SG) concept, conceived to improve and optimize the distribution and use of electrical energy. Then, the modelling and optimization framework proposed in this paper adopts a more systematic methodology for accounting of the \{EIP\} complexity characteristics and addressing the associated optimization challenges. The proposed approach allows ensuring a sustainable and robust \{EIP\} design, thanks to the due account given to the related uncertainties and risks, e.g., due to major changes in the regulatory context and \{IA\} operational strategies, failures of interconnections among IA, interruption or shutdown of \{IA\} operation.},

However, symbiosis will also increase the interdependence of plants, such that when one plant fails, there will be a cascading effect in the entire network. In this work, a criticality index is proposed to quantify the effects of a plant's failure to run at full capacity. This index is the ratio of the fractional change in the net output to the fractional change in capacity of the plant causing the failure. The plants in the entire bioenergy park can then be ranked based on this index. Such information can then be used for developing risk mitigation measures, such us planning for system redundancy. A case study is presented to demonstrate how the method determines the criticality of plants within a bioenergy park.},

	abstract = {Industrial ecology and the industrial ecosystem approach (IE) are emerging concepts in ecological economics, environmental policy and corporate environmental management. The natural ecosystem model of diverse recycling and cascading material and energy flow systems has been used in industrial systems that are contrasting to this, operating with linear flows and unsustainable. Understanding the evolution of industrial systems over time toward sustainable or unsustainable ways of operating is important for learning about environmental performance analyses as well as for future planning of policy and management. The evolution over time of the Uimaharju forest industry park in Eastern Finland is studied. First, the system development is described by identifying the number of IE-type ‘roundput’ material and energy flows denoting waste utilisation and sustainable use of renewables. Second, development of the system over time is shown in terms of the number of the actors involved. This structural characteristic is termed system ‘diversity’. Third, the relation of the two is considered. Fourth, the drivers of the case system development are discussed. Fifth, an initial effort is made to calculate some of the environmental effects of the system during its development. An increase in roundput and diversity over time is observed. Diversity is affecting roundput. The park tends to enlarge its activities outside the industrial park boundary over time. While the system illustrates high roundput and high diversity, we can only speculate if these characteristics contribute to sustainability, because of difficulties in system boundary definition.},

Technology is important to support symbiosis, but few studies in China have focused on this topic at the industrial park level. This research presented a case study in a national iron and steel industrial park in China. Focus was given onto carbon mitigation through industrial symbiosis technology using substance flow analysis (SFA). Three typical iron and steel industry technologies, including coke dry quenching (CDQ), combined cycle power plant (CCPP), and CO2 capture by slag carbonization (CCSC) were evaluated with SFA. Technology assessment was further conducted in terms of carbon mitigation potential and unit reduction cost. Compared with the Business as usual (BAU) scenario, application with CDQ, CCPP, and CCSC reduced the net carbon emissions by 56.18, 134.43, and 222.89 kg CO2 per ton crude steel inside the industrial parks, respectively, including both direct and indirect emissions. Economic assessment revealed that the unit costs for the three technologies were also high, thereby necessitating national financial support. Finally, relevant policy suggestions and future concerns were proposed and discussed.},

	abstract = {Abstract Power plants are one of key energy sources for industrial symbiosis complexes. However, decarbonization of the power sector, including decommissioning of existing fossil-fuel power plants, aggregation of power plant sites, and capacity augmentation of carbon-free power plants, is necessary to achieve low-carbon societies in the long term. Decarbonization results in declining advantage for industrial symbiosis complexes that rely on fossil-fuel power plants. To establish sustainable industrial symbiosis complexes, we used a quantitative model to analyze optimal locations and scales for power plants in Japan considering CO2 emissions reduction targets and several demand scenarios. Our results showed that even with a target of 80\% CO2 emission reduction, almost half of Japan's electricity generation could come from fossil-fuel power plants in 2050 if CCS technology were deployed widely. Fossil-fuel power plants would be developed mainly in the regions of high electricity demand and little wind power potential, such as Tokyo, Chubu, and Kansai. From an intra-regional perspective, fossil-fuel power plants could be constructed in areas of high electricity demand. In addition, except for the above areas, generation from fossil-fuel power plants would vary in accordance with the availability of renewables and electricity demand. Our results indicate that future climate policy, regional electricity demand, and availability of regional renewables should be considered when planning the development of industrial symbiosis complexes.},

Previous research on the metabolic processes for the elements that flow through eco-industrial parks has mainly accounted for the flows, stocks, and utilization efficiency of a few elements, but few studies have analyzed the complex internal characteristics of these metabolic processes by combining their structural and functional attributes. In this study, we analyzed the delivery and transformation processes and the internal characteristics of the industrial metabolic processes for sulfur in the Lubei eco-industrial park. By using network analysis, we were able to analyze the structural and functional characteristics of this network from the perspective of nodes (members of the network) and paths (flows between the nodes), and by combining an assessment of the characteristics of the nodes (degree, betweenness, closeness) and the paths (flow quantities and directions), we identified the key node (the cement clinker production), peripheral nodes (the ammonia and power plants), and key paths in the network (from the sulfuric acid plant to the ammonium phosphate plant, from the cement clinker production to the sulfuric acid plant, and from the ammonium phosphate plant to the cement clinker production). These results reveal the advantages and disadvantages of the Lubei eco-industrial park in terms of its structure and function, and suggest ways to improve the efficiency and the sustainable development of the park.},

Therefore, a systematic design approach is needed to facilitate the successful implementation of these networks.

It has been successfully applied in industrial ecology, in which localized phenomena of industrial symbiosis have been a key focus, and where metrics from both the social and natural sciences are used to understand socio-metabolic structures. In this paper we classify such studies as Social-Material Network Analyses and we discuss the body of work, drawing on network analyses from various disciplines. A challenge is the hierarchical nature of industrial networks and how it can be addressed socially. We discuss the opportunities and limitations of metric-driven network analysis and offer a review of methodological options for Social-Material Network Analyses.},

	abstract = {Abstract Industrial park development has become a critical strategy to promote economic development in many countries since 1980s. Particularly, China is one key country to adopt such a method on enhancing its industrialization. However, rapid industrial park development has resulted in many issues, including resource depletion, environmental emissions and pressure on responding climate change. Industrial symbiosis has been proved that it has positive impacts on promoting resource utilization efficiency. Therefore, effective performance evaluation can help recognize the key barriers on industrial symbiosis of industrial parks so that more appropriate policies can be raised by considering the local realities. Emergy synthesis is one feasible method on addressing the contribution of local ecosystem to industrial park development due to its innovative perspectives and mature methodology, while impact, population, affluence, technology (IPAT) formula and index decomposition analysis (IDA) are suitable for identifying and quantitatively calculating the key impacts of various factors. This paper integrated emergy synthesis, IPAT formula and IDA methods together to investigate the impact factors of industrial symbiosis in an industrial park. A case study approach at Dalian Economic Development Area (DEDA) was carried out so that such an effort can be tested. The results show that waste reutilization by industrial symbiosis in DEDA increased by 3.0E+20 seJ from 2006 to 2010. Technological pressure for waste utilization by industrial symbiosis and energy structure of an industrial park had made negative effects on the waste reutilization from 2006 to 2010 in DEDA, while the efficiency of non-renewable energy consumption and emergy scale of an industrial park played positive effects on the waste reutilization. Among the four impact factors, technological pressure for waste utilization and the efficiency of non-renewable energy consumption took more significant impacts on the industrial symbiosis of DEDA than the other two factors, which contributed −1.92E+21 seJ and 2.18E+21 seJ for the waste reutilization by industrial symbiosis respectively.},

In relation to the growing attention for regional types of industrial ecology, the article aims to provide a useful social science analytical framework for investigating regional industrial ecology, and to develop a prescriptive approach that can stimulate such industrial ecology. Regional industrial ecological systems meet with static and dynamic issues as a result of specific system boundaries of their decision-making levels. The analytical framework provides insight into these issues through a focus on three phases of (regional) industrial ecology, the production of collective goods, and governance mechanisms. We find that the INES Mainport project is still in the first phase of industrial ecology. To go beyond this phase, the Rotterdam harbour and industry region faces the limits of system boundaries of the decision-making levels within the regional management.},

	abstract = {Abstract The use of process integration (PI) tools in industrial ecology (IE) applications, particularly industrial symbiosis (IS), can lead to greater sustainability gains than is possible for single plants or companies. Such integration is facilitated by the advent of eco-industrial parks (EIPs) which use geographic clustering to promote sustainable exchange of materials and energy streams among different plants and companies. In particular, PI methods have been developed for total site integration and successfully implemented in documented industrial cases. However, one aspect of interplant integration is not easily done using classical PI methods, since each potential partner company will participate in a symbiosis scheme specifically with the motivation of increasing its own profits. The self-interest of each partner thus results in conflict of interest which, if not resolved, may result in the failure of the initiative. To address this problem, it is necessary to use an approach based on cooperative game theory which involves pooling the benefits, and then subsequently developing a rational and defensible scheme for sharing the incremental profits among the partners. In this work, we propose the application of a linear programming (LP) cooperative game model to allocate benefits that accrue from interplant integration in an EIP. The approach is first demonstrated using a literature case study, and the results are compared with those determined via alternative cooperative game techniques. Two industrial case studies on interplant integration in palm-based biomass processing complex and sago-based biorefinery (SBB) are then solved to further illustrate the applicability of this technique to problems of more realistic scale.},

The framework combines the principles of rational allocation of benefits with the consideration of stability and robustness of the coalition to changes in cost assumptions by analyzing its stability threshold. The stability threshold allows stakeholders to make informed managerial decisions concerning the current or future plant interactions in an EIP. The proposed framework is presented via a palm oil eco-industrial park (PEIP) case study consisting of a biomass tri-generation system (BTS), palm-based biorefinery (PBB) and palm oil mill (POM). The results of the case study indicate that the deserving annual cost savings allocation for BTS, \{PBB\} and \{POM\} are 38\% (USD 2,100,000), 14\% (USD 800,000) and 48\% (USD 2,600,000) of the total annual cost savings respectively. Based on these allocations, the stability analysis determined that the \{PEIP\} coalition will stable as long as the symbiosis costs of BTS, \{PBB\} and \{POM\} fall within 37–46\%, 10–30\% and 20–25\% of their respective raw material costs. Otherwise, the stability of the \{PEIP\} coalition is compromised and further action can be taken as stipulated in the proposed framework.},

The results demonstrated that networks with high initial investment or higher value-added products tend to have high economic performance. Additionally, several projects involving energy networks have resulted in high positive environmental performance through greenhouse gas emissions mitigation. Waste acid/alkali solution recycling projects also showed remarkable social outcomes on account of the variety of networks formed and active participation from enterprises. The present approach incorporating the DCF and MAGIQ methods provides a simple and promising decision-making tool for quantitative performance evaluation of EIP pilot projects.

	abstract = {Industrial Ecology involves the transformation of industrial processes from linear to closed loop systems: matter and energy flows which were initially considered as wastes become now resources for existing or new processes. In this paper, Thermoeconomics, commonly used for the optimization and diagnosis of energy systems, is proposed as a tool for the characterization of Industrial Ecology. Thermoeconomics is based on the exergy analysis (Thermodynamics) but goes further by introducing the concepts of purpose and cost (Economics). It is presented in this study as a systematic and general approach for the analysis of waste flow integration. The formulation is based on extending the thermoeconomic process of the cost formation of wastes in order to consider their use as input for other processes. Consequently, it can be applied to important Industrial Ecology issues such as identification of integration possibilities and efficiency improvement, quantification of benefits obtained by integration, or determination of fair prices based on physical roots. The capability of the methodology is demonstrated by means of a case study based on the integration of a power plant, a cement kiln and a gas-fired boiler.},

	abstract = {The application of ecological concepts to the industrial setting has been touched upon by literature across several disciplines. Two emerging ecological planning approaches, landscape ecology and industrial ecology, are applied here to look at alternative ways of planning industrial parks. As an emerging field, landscape ecology provides different viewpoints from the traditional approach of natural conservation, which mainly focuses on the protection of nature. The approach of landscape ecology regards the environment as a land mosaic, a mixture of natural and urban environment, which concerns a manageable human-scale environment across one or two human generations. Industrial ecology, on the other hand, goes beyond the traditional “end of pipe” idea of pollution control and learns from the ecosystem concept. The current paper is an attempt to reconcile these two fields as an integrated approach to the planning of industrial areas. Using a case study of Singapore’s Jurong Island industrial park, two fundamental issues behind the idea of landscape ecology and industrial ecology are raised. If raw materials, energy and by-products are more easily replaced or reused by technology and management, then research on industrial ecology and related knowledge will be crucial for developing natural resource substitution by innovative technology and new ways of environmental management. Where it is difficult to substitute natural resources, the skills of planning and managing natural resources will take priority over other strategies. In this situation, the knowledge of landscape ecology needs to be applied to the prediction, design and evaluation of ecologically optimum resource uses, patterns and processes in the mixture of natural, urban and industrial environment. A new concept, “nurtured landscape”, is proposed for mediating between the natural ecosystem and the urban/industrial environment. The nurtured landscape provides a basis for the development of new ecological technology using landscape to ameliorate the polluting effects of the urban/industrial neighbourhood. The planning of Singapore’s Jurong Island industrial park provides a test of applying the principles of landscape ecology and industrial ecology to the possible transformation of an industrial area.},

	abstract = {Rapidly industrializing Asian countries (RIACs) face both development and environmental challenges. The increasing resource and environmental pressures have impeded RIACs' efforts to quickly promote their people's quality of life, while protecting their natural environment. Due to lack of resources, technologies and capital, RIACs need to seek a more integrated development strategy. Industrial ecology may be one solution, as it aims at optimizing the use of materials and energy in products, processes, industrial sectors and economies by systemically mimicking natural systems in an industrial setting. The relevant practices and experiences in the developed world have proved that there is a degree of effectiveness and efficiency to development through the application of industrial ecology. It is even more critical to applying the principles of industrial ecology in RIACs with fewer resources. However, compared with the developed nations, RIACs face different environmental, economic and social constraints. Therefore, RIACs have to adopt different approaches to implement the concept of industrial ecology. In this paper, we first introduce the environmental, economic and social constraints in RIACs and imply that RIACs need a sustainable industrial development strategy, namely, ‘producing more with less’. Then, we review the current practices on eco-industrial development in RIACs. As a specific case study, due to its size and increasing influence on the global economy and politics, China will be examined in detail with regard to its eco-industrial development practices. Through these approaches, the challenges to applying industrial ecology to RIACs will be analyzed and recommendations are provided.},

There local system is experiencing major changes because of tightening EC waste legislation including the directives on waste incineration (2000/76/EC) and landfilling of wastes (1999/31/EC). Small local landfills are closing and most of municipal wastes will be transported 120–180 km to large-scale waste management centre in Kuopio. The paper applies three industrial ecosystem indicators, based on environmental, economic and employment impacts of different waste management technologies. Environmental indicator is CO2 equivalent emission, economic indicator is based on costs and revenues of waste management, and social (i.e. employment) indicator includes new jobs generated. The results indicate that waste incineration option in forthcoming regional cooperation could create emission savings up to 117–394 kg CO2 eqv./ton of municipal waste when compared to local landfilling. As economic impacts, new regional cooperation and long-distance transportations will increase the costs from previous 45.6–55.2 €/ton in local landfilling to 97.4 €/ton in regional landfilling and 120.8–126.9 €/ton in regional REF-III incineration. In terms of employment, the new cooperation could create 2–6.5 new jobs. The regional cooperation results to rising operational costs but avoids investments to new local infrastructure. It also creates significant emission savings, maintains current employment in waste handling and creates new jobs in long-distance transportation.},

Water is a key focus in the Kwinana industrial area, Western Australia's major heavy industrial region, where some 30 companies consume more than 35 000 mega litres per year of fresh water. Over the past decade, significant progress has been made towards the reduction of water consumption and improvements in effluent disposal in Kwinana. Another way to advance sustainable water use is through the realisation of regional synergies. These concern the capture, recovery and reuse of water and energy byproducts from other industries in close proximity. With up to 50 existing synergies already in place, Kwinana is recognised as a world leading example; however, more synergy opportunities appear to exist. Research is being undertaken to further develop synergies in Kwinana and also to deliver a targeted and customised toolkit.

The main objectives of this review are to introduce how Korea established its own approach to nationwide eco-industrial development and to examine the program's successes and limiting factors to draw lessons about how industrial symbiosis can be developed successfully elsewhere. The Korean EIP program emerged from a context of 50 years of industrial development to transform traditional industrial structures into EIPs using cleaner production at the industrial park level. During the first five years, regional EIP centers established at five pilot sites developed and implemented 47 resource-sharing projects, which generated considerable economic and environmental benefits. This was possible due to an institutional system that effectively combined top-down and bottom-up approaches and to the mediating role of regional EIP centers, which bring together local stakeholders from businesses, governments, and research organizations. By learning during the first phase, Korea has established its own model for eco-industrial development that will continue to develop during the second and third phases.},

	abstract = {Backcasting has been widely used for developing energy futures. This paper explores the potential for using industrial ecology to guide the development of energy futures within a backcasting framework. Building on the backcasting work of Robinson [1], a seven step method is presented to embed industrial ecology principles within the development and assessment of future scenarios and transition paths toward them. The approach is applied to the case of backcasting regional energy futures in the Latrobe Valley, near Melbourne, Australia. This region has substantial brown coal deposits which are currently mined and used in coal-fired power stations to generate electricity. Bounded by a sustainability vision for the region in a carbon-constrained world, regional industrial ecologies in 2050 were backcast around three themes: bio-industries and renewables (no coal usage); electricity from coal with carbon capture and storage (low to high coal usage); and coal to products such as hydrogen, ammonia, diesel, methanol, plastics and char (demonstrating medium to high overall coal use relative to current levels). Potential environmental, technological, socio-political and economic impacts of each scenario across various life cycle stages were characterised. Results offer a platform for regional policy development to underpin deliberation on a preferred future by the community, industry and other stakeholders. Industrial ecology principles were found to be useful in backcasting for creatively articulating alternative futures featuring industrial symbiosis. However, enabling the approach to guide implementation of sustainable transition pathways requires further development and would benefit from integration within the Strategic Sustainable Development framework of Robèrt et al.

Considering that the participating plants have their individual fuzzy cost goals and that the park authority has the objective of minimizing total freshwater consumption in the EIP, this problem may be formulated as a bi-level optimization problem, with the park authority as the upper-level decision-maker. A bi-level fuzzy optimization model is developed to explore the effect of charging fees for the purchase of freshwater and the treatment of wastewater in optimizing the water exchange network of plants in an EIP. The effect of subsidizing exchange of streams between plants is also included in the model. Results show that it is not necessary to impose exorbitant fees, nor to completely subsidize costs associated with recycling, in order to induce significant reduction of the consumption of freshwater in the EIP.},

In particular, we analyze shifts in the network orchestrator's actions and the network's structure and composition. We find that an orchestrator builds the capacity to assemble a network over time through the accumulation of resources and specialized expertise. However, as the network develops, an orchestrator faces an evolving set of dilemmas arising from the need to demonstrate value for various members and audiences. To resolve these dilemmas, orchestrators may shift their actions, moving from initially encouraging serendipitous encounters between network members (“blind dates”) to increasingly selecting members and more closely influencing their interactions (“arranging marriages”). We discuss implications of our findings for a processual understanding of orchestrated network assembly and growth.},

This paper reviews the stakeholders' understanding of EIPs. Furthermore, research was conducted on the barriers to the actual promotion of the project in South Korea. First, stakeholders' understanding of EIPs is identified as being self-interested. The need for EIPs is mostly found in responding to civil complaints and pollutants resulting from the industrial park. However, the need is quite different from the original intention of EIPs. As a result, the project unsuccessfully deals with the needs of the stakeholders because of technical, economic, and social obstacles. Second, support from the public sector for the project seems quite inadequate. The public sector appears to lack the proper policy means and will to actualize the project. In conclusion, the Korean government needs to participate more actively in the project than it currently is doing. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.},

	abstract = {Publisher Summary Nonhazardous industrial waste (NHIW) is distinct from both municipal solid waste (MSW), the more familiar mix from homes and businesses, and hazardous waste, materials that are more highly regulated owing to their toxicity and related public health concerns. The sheer quantities of NHIW raise the question of how best to manage it. The first defense is cleaner production—generating less waste by increasing industrial efficiency and effectiveness. A broad range of companies now produce annual sustainability reports detailing the amount of waste reduced in particular categories, year to year. For wastes that continue to be generated, many large volume industrial streams are amenable to separate handling such as foundry sand, coal ash, and paper mill sludge, some of these streams have an excellent track record for reuse. Specifically, industrial symbiosis is part of a new field called industrial ecology. Industrial ecology is principally concerned with the flow of materials and energy through systems at different scales, from products to factories and up to national and global levels. Industrial symbiosis focuses on these flows through networks of businesses and other organizations in local and regional economies as a means of approaching ecologically sustainable industrial development. It engages traditionally separate industries in a collective approach to competitive advantage involving physical exchange of materials, energy, water, and/or by-products. The keys to industrial symbiosis are collaboration and the synergistic possibilities offered by geographic proximity.},

These industrial partnerships include the City of Choctaw Waste Water Treatment Plant, a tire shredding company, a tire pyrolysis company, a hydroponics industry, a hard rubber tire manufacturer, a screen printer, a plastics manufacturer, a toner manufacturer, and a toner cartridge manufacturer. The nature of this relationship and the design of the eco-industrial park is contained within this report.

This strategy expands the application of CE from individual enterprises to eco-industrial parks (EIPs) and to the cities, provinces, and regions. We carried out field studies in three EIPs in Baotou, Suzhou, and Shanghai. In this paper, we discuss the current state of CE and the sustainable development of EIPs in China. We first provide detailed information on the three EIPs' infrastructures, preferential policies, CE frameworks, and eco-chains. We then examine the status of sustainable development in the three EIPs from the perspectives of socio-economic, resource and material efficiency, and environmental performance. The results indicate that the overall performance of the three EIPs is reasonably good with respect to socio-economics, resources and materials, and efficiency and environmental protection, whereas green management is rather weak and thus requires further improvement. We found that the CE frameworks along with eco-chains within the EIPs are effectively improving resource and material efficiency. Moreover, we demonstrate that there are positive associations among socio-economic, resource and material, and environmental indicators. Given the large presence of EIPs in the local economies, these results suggest that EIPs play a key role in promoting sustainable development in China.},

	abstract = {Abstract As a key economic development source of urban industrial symbiosis, industrial parks are an effective strategy to facilitate economic development and have been globally recognized and practiced. However, rapid development of these industrial parks has also generated several problems, such as intensive resource consumption and increasing environmental pollution caused by industrial activities. Sustainable development of industrial parks has become a global concern. In this regard, various strategies and projects have been adopted such as eco-industrial park development, low-carbon industrial park construction, circular economy industrial park. However, due to different levels of economic development and different operational system, the pathways of industrial parks towards sustainable development between developing country and developed country have differed. Their experiences and disadvantages should be explored by other countries in similar circumstances. This paper aims to fill such a gap by carrying out case studies between China and Canada, two countries identified as a rapidly developing country and a developed country. Both countries have encouraged to develop industrial parks to support economic development and have recently began to explore whether they can lead to sustainable industrial development. To support the analysis, Tianjin Economic Development area (TEDA), the largest industrial park in terms of its economic scale in China, and Burnside Industrial Park, which is one of the largest park in Canada, were selected as comparative case studies. Through the analysis on the adopted policies strategies and practices, the results indicate that China has put much more effort into their eco-industrial park due to the urgent situation of resource pressure and environmental pollution utilizing a top-down management system. Industrial parks in Canada appear to be moving more slowly in their adoption of sustainable development.},

As eco-industrial developments have resulted in varying levels of success it is necessary for new EID programmes to understand the lessons from both the successful and less successful earlier cases. This study has been undertaken to compare the implication of the National Industrial symbiosis Programme (NISP) in the UK, regarded as an active EID case, with the Korean eco-industrial park scheme as a newly implemented one. The two EID models were analysed with a framework centred on three practical aspects: the underlying approach to EID, the organisational framework and the operational framework. Comparing the two models based on the three aspects, this study suggests several implications for the implementation of EID in Korea, including business centred approach, expanding EIPs to regional EID, standardising operational framework and developing innovative synergy generation tools.},

	abstract = {The necessity to follow the rules of sustainable development in the everyday industrial practice has led to the formulation of the concept of an industrial ecosystem mimicking the natural ecosystem, since about fourteen years old. The core of industrial ecology, the industrial ecosystem model has become a framework for studying the interactions of the modern technological society with the environment. The Strategies for manufacturing an industrial ecosystem is a system, in which the consumption of energy and material is optimized, waste generation is minimized and the effluents of one process serve as the raw material for another process. The concept of an industrial ecosystem was based on the flows of materials through the life cycles, otherwise known as industrial symbiosis. In the present study, we propose the mathematical modeling of different industrial symbiosis material/energy. To achieve the following aims: maximizing of flows, reducing the distances between different firms, reducing the wastes treatment cost, reducing the equipment treatment costs and connecting costs, we adopt the formulation of objective function, in which we detailed the different constraints in order to obtain the optimal material/energy flows an industrial cluster.

	abstract = {Although relatively under-studied, industrial symbiosis may be a particularly valuable type of interfirm action for creating value under economic constraints, such as increased environmental regulations, because it involves firms collaborating to find economical ways to “do more with less”, by taking wastes and excess resources from one firm and processing them into valuable inputs for another. To better understand its value-creating potential, we analyzed firm- and policy-level environmental and economic outcomes for 313 industrial symbiosis exchanges across the United Kingdom, during a period of increasing environmental taxation and regulation. We found that, 1) exchanges involving larger volumes of material resources are more likely to create firm- and policy-level value; 2) firms with prior industrial symbiosis experience are more likely to create firm-level value; and, 3) exchanges involving dedicated waste firms are more likely to create policy-level value, although somewhat less likely to create firm-level value. Extending prior work on intra-firm action research, we show how firms can also create value through interfirm industrial symbiosis collaborations in response to regulatory constraints. We develop a deeper understanding of the types of outcomes likely to occur from industrial symbiosis exchanges, and detail firm- and policy-level implications and questions for future research.},

	volume = {19},
	abstract = {The trend of clustering industries into regional estates or cities was adopted in the mid 1900's. At present, the number of industrial estates in the world is estimated to be between 12,000 and 20,000 (UNEP, 1997) and this trend is continuing to rise in both developed and developing countries. The implementation of the EIP concept continues to evolve especially with the environmental threats and impact on climate change that industries pose. However, there is not yet a fully developed EIP that is operating; although some successful examples of regional by-product exchanges are functioning (Lowe, 2001; Peck, 2002; Lowe et al., 1995: Chertow, 2000). Actually, a significant number of projects have failed or have abandoned the goal of becoming an EIP. Furthermore the current body of knowledge on industrial ecology is not sufficient to provide practical solutions to the obstacles facing EIPs. This paper is based upon the Ph.D. Doctoral thesis research of D. Sakr. It was prepared to examine means to improve the uptake of cleaner production \& industrial symbiosis in industrial areas in Middle East \& North Africa Region focusing on Egypt as a case study. An extensive literature review was performed on eco-industrial development projects' experiences around the world, in order to identify the critical driving and limiting factors for EIPs. This paper summarizes the lessons learned from worldwide EIP experiences as a basis for the planning and implementation of future EIPs. The paper reflects as well upon the Egyptian context for the identified EIP success and limiting factors. The identified key success and limiting factors are: the creation of symbiotic relationship, information sharing and awareness, financial benefits, organizational structure, and legal and regulatory framework.

The development of industrial areas include several phases, one of them is the location decision that is one of the most important, since it will determine the park operation. For a long time, the location theories have only considered the proximity to raw materials, existence of basic infrastructures and qualified manpower. Nevertheless, the new model of sustainable development demands to realize a planning that defines and integrates the different subsystems and influential aspects. The aim of this work is to create a conceptual descriptive model to locate sustainable industrial areas. This model is based on long-established factors and new strategies and experiences of sustainability. The second step is the establishment of a diffuse evaluation system that determines the fulfilment of defined sustainable criteria. This model makes the planning process for the decision-makers easier through a system that considers multiple criteria that converge in order to get the balance of industrial activities with the environment.},

The approach uses a combination of optimization and simulation tools. Assuming “top-down” overarching control of the network, we use global dynamic optimization to determine which evolutionary pathways are preferred in terms of economic, social, and environmental performance. Considering the autonomy of network entities and their actions, we apply agent-based simulation to analyze how the network actually evolves. These two perspectives are integrated into a powerful multiscale modeling framework for evaluating the consequences of new policy instruments or different business strategies aimed at stimulating sustainable development as well as identifying optimal leverage points for improved performance of the network in question. The approach is demonstrated for a regional network of interdependent organizations deploying a set of bioenergy technologies within a developing-economy context.},

A source-interception-sink structural representation is used to embed potential configurations of interest. The representation accounts for the possibilities of direct recycle, material (waste) exchange, mixing and segregation of different streams, separation and treatment in interception units, and allocation to process users (sinks). Then, the EIP design problem is formulated as an optimization program whose objective is to minimize cost of the EIP while determining optimal recycle and separation strategies.

	abstract = {The field of industrial ecology promotes the establishment of resource exchange networks in eco-industrial parks (EIPs) as an approach toward resource conservation. Previous studies have shown that full blown resource integration can be encouraged through the exchange of common utilities such as energy and water. Different approaches such as mathematical programming, pinch analysis and game theory have been used to identify the optimal network designs, which can simultaneously reduce the utilization of freshwater resources and the generation of wastewater streams. Since water exchange in an EIP involves multiple independently operating plants, information exchange between the participants is not completely transparent and multiple future scenarios are expected to happen as the fate and plans of other participants are not completely divulged. These future scenarios may bring about changes in the capacity or characteristic of industrial processes and may also involve the entry of additional companies and the closure of previously operating ones. Such aspects have not been fully addressed in previous studies. A robust optimization model is thus developed in this work to determine the optimal network design which can effectively operate in anticipation of multiple probable scenarios.

	abstract = {Abstract The emergence of environmental and sustainability regulations, such as Kyoto protocol, Energy Policy Act and the increasingly limited availability of fossil fuels has brought the notion of gradually substituting petroleum products with bioethanol into the limelight. Even though, bioethanol is one of the cleanest sources of energy, a major concern of bioethanol production is its economic feasibility. Industrial symbiosis is one of the sustainable strategies that can help to reduce bioethanol production and logistic costs. In industrial symbiosis, traditionally separate plants collocate in order to efficiently utilize resources, reduce wastes and increase profits for the entire industrial symbiosis and each player in the industrial symbiosis. This paper focuses on developing optimal configurations of bioenergy-based industrial symbiosis under certain constraints, such that the bioethanol production cost (or profit) is reduced (or increased). A decision framework that combines the Linear Programming models and large scale Mixed Integer Linear Programming model is proposed to determine the optimal configuration of bioenergy-based industrial symbiosis and to design the optimal network flows of various products in the bioenergy-based industrial symbiosis. A case study has been conducted to study the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed model and the results suggest significant increase in profitability for biorefinery plant and the rest of the players in the bioenergy-based industrial symbiosis system. Sensitivity analysis is also conducted to provide deep understanding of the proposed bioenergy-based industrial symbiosis system and to identify the factors that might impact the performance of biorefinery plant in bioenergy-based industrial symbiosis.},

	abstract = {Abstract The concept of eco-industrial park (EIP) has recently become the subject of a great deal of attention from industry and academic research groups. This paper proposes a series of systematic approaches for multi-level modelling and optimisation in EIPs. The novelties of this work include, (1) building a four-level modelling framework (from unit level to process level, plant level and industrial network level) for \{EIP\} research, (2) applying advanced mathematical modelling methods to describe each level operation, (3) developing efficient methodologies for solving optimisation problems at different \{EIP\} levels, (4) considering symbiotic relations amongst the three networks (material, water and energy networks) at the top \{EIP\} level with the boundary conditions of economic, social and legal requirements. For methodology demonstration, two cases at process level and industrial network level respectively are tested and solved with the developed modelling and optimisation strategies. Finally, the challenges and applications in future \{EIP\} research are also discussed, including data collection, the extension of the current networks to EIPs, and the feasibility of the proposed methodologies for complex \{EIP\} problems. The extended \{EIPs\} include the combination of material exchanges, energy systems and waste-water treatment networks. The aspects considered for future industrial ecology are carbon emission, by-product reuse, water consumption, and energy consumption. The main object of this paper is to explain the detailed model construction process and the development of optimisation approaches for a complex \{EIP\} system. In future work, this system is expected to share services, utility, and product resources amongst industrial plants to add value, reduce costs, improve environment, and consequently achieve sustainable development in a symbiosis community.},

	abstract = {China is pioneering a new sustainable development model which has the ability to overcome current environmental and resource management problems, while achieving improvements in resource productivity and eco-efficiency. This model, formally accepted in 2002 and termed the 'circular economy', is understood to mean the realisation of a closed loop of material flows in the Chinese economic system. Successful implementation of this model is seen as one way in which China can 'leapfrog' past environmental damage that is typically seen as economies industrialise. This paper introduces the development of the model in China, and presents the current situation of circular economy practice in China. The paper describes current measures being implemented in China for the long-term promotion of a circular economy, including the formulation of objectives, legislation, policies and measures, so that the country can 'leapfrog' its way from environmentally-damaging development to a more sustainable path. The paper then identifies a series of barriers and challenges to the implementation of the concept in China. Finally, conclusions on the future of the circular economy concept are drawn. Data were derived primarily from an analysis of secondary sources (i.e. previously published papers). Additional primary data derived from the main author's personal involvement in several circular economy initiatives were also employed.},

	abstract = {The development of regional resource synergies in heavy industrial areas provides a significant avenue towards sustainable resource processing. Despite the fact that the number of examples of regional resource synergies around the world is growing, the reuse of inorganic by-products (e.g. bauxite residue, fly ash, kiln dusts, gypsum, slag) in Australia have not yet materialised on a significant scale. This is due to the fragmented approach adopted in the past and a range of barriers associated with their reuse. The drivers and barriers for inorganic by-product reuses appear to fall in nine broad categories: regulation, economics, community, technology, transportation, confidential and commercial issues, risk and liabilities, industry focus and priorities, and region specific issues. This paper shows that significant potential exist for the establishment of large volume reuse of these inorganic by-products in Australia, using the Kwinana Industrial Area as a case study. The inorganic by-products available in Kwinana could be used to supply the growing demand for already scarce building and construction materials in Western Australia. Although regulatory reuse standards exist elsewhere (e.g. European Union, USA), one of the main obstacles for the Kwinana industries is the absence of standard application protocols to allow for the routine use of their inorganic by-products. A coordinated stakeholder approach is being facilitated and applied in Kwinana that targets the realisation of large volume reuse opportunities that have both a good business and sustainability case and also government and community support. Based on the Kwinana experiences, this paper provides perspectives and learnings for elsewhere in Australia and in countries where current regulatory frameworks do not encourage or restrict the uptake of inorganic by-product reuses on a large scale.},

As each owner has its own profit-oriented goals, and thus the concept of industrial symbiosis (IS) is needed to facilitate their cooperation. A novel disjunctive fuzzy optimisation approach is introduced to determine the optimum pathways based on processing plants' declared interests. In cases where any processing plant's interest is not satisfied, that party can elect to withdraw from the BBIS scheme; such decisions are reflected via disjunctive fuzzy optimisation. The optimum network configuration with the maximum economic performance can be determined based on the proposed approach, and individual interests of participating owners are equitably satisfied within mutually agreed bounds. A palm oil industrial case study is used to illustrate the proposed approach.},

Besides its name and a number of borrowed concepts, however, industrial ecology has no formal relationship with the ecological sciences. This study explores the potential for further interdisciplinary collaboration by testing whether some of the same quantitative analysis techniques used in community ecology research can have meaning in an industrial context. Specifically, we applied the ecological concepts of connectance and diversity to an analysis of Burnside Industrial Park in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Our results demonstrate that these ecological tools show promise for use in industrial ecology. We discuss the meaning of connectance and diversity concepts in an industrial context and suggest next steps for future studies. We hope that this research will help to lay the groundwork of an ecologically inspired tool kit for analyzing industrial ecosystems.},

As a result of the widespread assumption that traditional market incentives and institutions are not conducive to such an outcome, however, there remains a fair amount of scepticism as to what the capacity of business self-interest to promote this behaviour actually is. This article challenges the dominant negative perspective by discussing by-product development in one of the most market-oriented societies in human history, Victorian England. Building on nineteenth and early twentieth century writings on the topic, as well as a more detailed analysis of the development of valuable by-products from highly problematic iron and coal gas production residuals, a case is made that the search for increased profitability within the context of private property rights often simultaneously promoted economic and environmental progress in the long run, as well as on different geographical scales.},

	abstract = {Abstract Chinese government promotes ecological civilization in the “13th five year planning” (2016–2020) period. As a result, ecological impacts become highlight in the national circular economy practices. To apply the eco-industrial development strategy to address the intertwined industrial and regional economic development, as well as related environmental and ecological challenges is key point. Urban industrial symbiosis provides a novel approach to realize the above expectation. Traditional evaluation on circular economy provided critical environmental insights, while to date, ecological evaluation has been rather few for urban industrial symbiosis promotion. With this circumstance, this paper developed an integrated material flows analysis (MFA) and emergy evaluation model to investigate the environmental and ecological benefits of urban industrial symbiosis implementation in one typical industrial city in China. Local oriented urban industrial symbiosis network was analyzed. Inter flows and related environmental benefits of symbiotic network were quantified with MFA, and further ecological impacts were evaluated with emergy approach and the designed emergy index. From the environmental perspective, results highlighted, in general, urban industrial symbiosis generated significant life cycle environmental benefits, especially the reduction of upstream resource mining and downstream waste disposal within the regional metabolism. In total, around 204.7 million tons ore mining, 6.9 million ton solid waste and 2.3 million tons \{CO2\} emissions were reduced per year. From the ecological perspective, total emergy input was reduced by 1.3 × 1022 sej, which reflected the reduction of ecological burden. Particularly, as a key indicator for ecological lost caused by pollution, dilution emergy was decreased by 2.5 × 1016 sej, resulting from carbon mitigation co-benefit of urban industrial symbiosis. This paper provided modeling approach to understand the ecological benefits and trade-offs of circular economy practices, and critical insights on regional eco-industrial development. It will shed a light on ecological civilization construction in China in the new national planning period.},

The model integrates the waste streams of mining industries in the Kola Peninsula in such a way that waste from one industrial operator becomes raw material for another. Using a counterfactual method, this article determines the eco-efficiency of the model between the years 1985 and 2005. A parallel study of the eco-efficiency of the actual system, i.e. in the absence of complex utilization, is then performed for the same time period. The study shows that complex utilization would indeed have yielded increased eco-efficiency, even though not all environmentally harmful emissions would have decreased. As a result of market collapse and the use of upstream pollution prevention together with traditional end-of-pipe technologies, however, the actual system shows net emission reductions similar to those modeled in complex utilization. It is suggested that in systems like the mining industry of the Kola Peninsula, with high production volumes and poorly developed environmental technologies, upstream pollution prevention together with traditional end-of-pipe technologies may prove more attractive than industrial symbiosis, despite the substantial increases in eco-efficiency of the latter.},

This article includes data from six of these EIP development projects. Three of the projects discussed are located in the Netherlands and three in the US. This article compares the differences in project approach and results on a national level. The approach suggested is derived from the available EIP development literature. Initial research indicates that the Dutch EIP projects are more successful than their US counterparts. This difference in success can be, mostly, attributed to the fact that the US projects are initiated by local and regional governments that see the project as a way to improve the local/regional economy with access to substantial government funds. Because of this heavy government involvement, US companies are, in general, not interested in the project. The more Successful Dutch projects, on the other hand, are mostly initiated by the companies themselves with financial and advisory support from the local and regional government.

In order to promote and regulate their development, two government agencies, the Ministry of Environmental Protection and the National Development and Reform Commission are currently engaged in promoting national pilot EIP programs. Both agencies have developed their own management systems, and 60 industrial parks have been approved for construction of national pilot EIPs, among which six parks appear in both lists of the two agencies. This article introduces the practice of the national pilot EIPs. It first describes the management systems and achievements within the two programs, and then summarizes the problems encountered thus far in program implementation. Finally it proposes brief suggestions for future development of EIPs.},

	title = {Eco-industrial parks: stimulating sustainable development in mixed industrial parks},
	volume = {22},
	abstract = {In several industrialised countries, there have occurred initiatives to establish eco-industrial parks. Originally, these were mainly based upon the exchange of resources between heavy industries in industrial complexes. These initiatives are generally referred to with the concepts of industrial symbiosis and eco-industrial parks. Since then, the concept of eco-industrial parks has been extended to another relevant type of industrial park, the so-called mixed industrial park, which consists of various small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), sometimes complemented by a small number of larger industries. Because of the resulting growing ambiguity in the significance of eco-industrial park initiatives, a typology is desirable for entangling the confusion that is introduced. It is argued that mixed industrial parks are poorly investigated although they have a major environmental and spatial impact, Starting from a general consideration of eco-industrial park initiatives, this paper describes the societal and environmental problems that are related to the mixed industrial parks, proposes solutions and discusses the counteracting factors. While our argument relates strongly to the traditionally industrialised countries, it is also relevant to newly industrialised countries, as they are faced with similar problems, or will encounter them in the near future.

	abstract = {Abstract China's Shandong Lubei eco-industrial park was approved for construction in 2003, just after the first national eco-industrial demonstration parks were confirmed by China's State Environmental Protection Administration in 2002. It has therefore been recognized around the world as a successful example of an industrial symbiosis system. The park's success results from the harmonious and coordinated relationships among its members. Analyzing the ecological characteristics of these relationships and identifying the resulting advantages provide a basis for improving the park's efficiency and examining other parks. In this paper, we analyzed the flows of sulfur in the Lubei park (as an example of typical flows) using ecological network analysis to describe this industrial symbiosis system. The integrated analysis of the utility resulting from direct and indirect exchanges of byproducts and wastes can reflect the ecological relationships among members within the system. Based on these ecological relationships, members can be divided into producers, primary consumers, and secondary consumers; the integral flow weight for each level of the hierarchy can then be compared to reveal the system's overall ecological structure. By examining the exchanges of resources within the system, we can describe the ecological connotations of the symbiosis and how these ecological relationships influence the overall development and resource flows within the system.},

	abstract = {Although, in the theory of industrial ecology, a recycling industry is essential in order to establish a closed loop material system, in practice, the contribution of that industry is still limited, and more studies are needed to enlarge its role. The objective of this paper is to quantitatively analyze factors that influence the performance of recycling projects in Japanese Eco-Towns. We develop two multi-regression models using questionnaire survey data from recycling facilities and cross-sectional data from 23 Eco-Towns to analyze the amount of waste treated by and the operating rate of recycling facilities. Dependent variables are introduced through a review of the literature on industrial symbiosis and the situation of Japanese Eco-Towns, focusing on three necessary features: recycling boundaries, government policy intervention, and local collaboration and partnership. The results of two simple regression models of recycling facilities in Eco-Towns offer several fruitful insights that aid in understanding the performance of recycling projects. First, recycling facilities' geographical proximity to users of recycled products can contribute to high operating rates. Second, subsidies for constructing facilities do not improve recycling projects' operating rates. Third, collaboration, rather than competition, among recycling facilities can improve their operating rates.},

	abstract = {Most chemical companies consume a lot of steam, water and electrical resources in the production process. Given recent record fuel costs, utility networks must be optimized to reduce the overall cost of production. Environmental concerns must also be considered when preparing modifications to satisfy the requirements for industrial utilities, since wastes discharged from the utility networks are restricted by environmental regulations. Construction of Eco-Industrial Parks (EIPs) has drawn attention as a promising approach for retrofitting existing industrial parks to improve energy efficiency. The optimization of the utility network within an industrial complex is one of the most important undertakings to minimize energy consumption and waste loads in the EIP.

In this work, a systematic approach to optimize the utility network of an industrial complex is presented. An important issue in the optimization of a utility network is the desire of the companies to achieve high profits while complying with the environmental regulations. Therefore, the proposed optimization was performed with consideration of both economic and environmental factors.

The proposed approach consists of unit modeling using thermodynamic principles, mass and energy balances, development of a multi-period Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model for the integration of utility systems in an industrial complex, and an economic/environmental analysis of the results. This approach is applied to the Yeosu Industrial Complex, considering seasonal utility demands. The results show that both the total utility cost and waste load are reduced by optimizing the utility network of an industrial complex.},

	abstract = {Abstract China's industrial parks have made great contributions to its economic growth with their rapid development. However, the resources and environment related issues have been challenging their sustainability to different degree. There still exist the following challenges in evaluating the sustainability of industrial systems due to the existing researches ignoring one or more related issues, including (1) ignorance of ecosystem's contributions to industrial activities, (2) neglect of quality differences between different resources, energies and labors, (3) involving subjectivity of human, (4) inadequate consideration of emissions' impact, and (5) lacking consideration on recycling and reuse benefit derived from industrial symbiosis. Therefore, they are isolated to some degree and lack completeness and systematization. This study aimed to deal with the five issues by adopting classic \{EA\} (emergy analysis) method (Overcoming issues 1–3.), quantifying emissions' impact in terms of emergy with some modified parameters (Addressing issue 4.) and proposing indicators to evaluating recycling and reuse benefit (Focusing on issue 5.). Then one proposed emergy method and the related indicator system for assessing the sustainability of industrial parks were set up. Next, an industrial park in Sichuan, China, as a case, was research using the proposed method and indicator system. The study results show that, according to the classic emergy based indicators, this industrial park has relatively high economic competition ability (EYR = 1.14), relatively low environmental press (ELR = 29.31), and relatively strong sustainability (ESI = 0.0388) compared to other industrial parks in China. However, its low economic efficiency and low wastes recycling/reuse degree still seriously challenge its sustainability with the local mineral resources exhaustion in the future. In terms of modified emergy indicators, emissions' impact further raises its environmental load by 3.42\% and reduces its sustainability level by 2.70\%. Finally, some corresponding suggestions are put forward.},

Due to lack of resources, technologies and capital, China needs to seek a more integrated development strategy. Industrial ecology (IE) may be one solution as it aims at optimizing the use of materials and energy in products, processes, industrial sectors and economies by systemically mimicking natural systems in an industrial setting. The relevant practices and experiences in the developed world have proved that there is a degree of effectiveness and efficiency to development through the application of IE. It is even more critical to apply the principles of IE in China, where resources are scarce. However, compared with developed nations, China faces different environmental, economic and social constraints. Therefore, China has to adopt different approaches to implement the concept of IE. In this paper, we first review the current practices in eco-industrial development in China. Then the advantages and barriers to applying IE in China are analyzed and recommendations are provided.

	abstract = {In the race against climate change, aiming for low-carbon competitiveness, Flanders has initiated a carbon neutrality strategy on industrial parks, building towards energy efficient buildings and processes, acting as a stimulus for the production and consumption of green electricity. However, premises and internal process optimisation on industrial parks is not considered sufficient to limit greenhouse emissions in Flanders. Structural transition is called for, aiming for industrial clustering and energy autonomy based on renewables. Therefore, the concept of industrial symbiosis is analysed to determine how it could improve the energy-related carbon management on industrial parks. This article explores the literature on industrial symbiosis and eco-industrial parks searching for specific energy strategies, and is illustrated with case studies. Energy management on industrial parks can be integrated in the entire development process and park management. Maximising efficiency is a promising local optimisation issue, in which business should be engaged, stimulated and facilitated. By clustering buildings and processes, by energy exchange, collective production and joint contracting of energy services, local synergies can be intensified. Yet, uncertainty and variability in time of energy consumption can keep developers from tailoring industrial park design and utilities. Instead flexibility and solidity could be gained, and the offer of business space could be diversified, supported by a persevering issuing procedure to join similar and matching energy profiles. Energy management on industrial parks in Flanders has only recently started but is expected to gain professionalism. However further research is needed on this flexible design and thermal planning.},

The quantification of the scale and significance of IS benefits is valuable for IS promotion, while there is much few attention to it, especially in China. Under this circumstance, this paper evaluates and compares the number, scale and the related environmental/economic gains of IS activities in iron/steel-centered industrial areas in Liuzhou and Jinan in China, and Kawasaki in Japan. Results show that: in Liuzhou, there are three symbiosis activities between industries. The annual by-product/waste exchange is more than 2 million ton/y, gaining economic revenue more than 36.55 million USD for the iron/steel company. In Jinan, seven symbiotic links are between industries, and two are between urban community and iron/steel plant. The total by-product/waste exchange is over 8 million ton/y and the economic gains account to 158 million USD. In Kawasaki, iron/steel industry relates to four symbiotic links, the total by-product/waste exchange amount is about 500 kton/y, with the economic gains over 54 million USD. The form and the complexity of the IS network are different in the three cases. IS in Liuzhou and Jinan are with the features of large number and scale, but single types. While in Kawasaki, IS includes not only traditional exchanges between iron/steel plant and the other industries, but also the innovative utilization of urban refuse by industrial area. Finally, from the perspective of technology, legislative framework and support policy, circular technology inventory, integrated waste management system, information platform and national subsidies are needed to support the ever-improvement of IS promotion in China's iron/steel industry.},

	abstract = {Industrial ecosystem is an important approach for sustainable development. In an industrial ecosystem, a group of industries are inter-connected through mass and energy exchanges for mutual benefits. However, some mass and energy exchange activities may cause unexpected environmental impacts. Therefore, it is vital to evaluate the environmental impacts of the symbiosis in order to provide a clear guidance for the decision-makers and stakeholders. The agro-chemical complex in the Lower Mississippi River Corridor with thirteen chemical and petrochemical industries emits huge amount of carbon dioxide. A bi-level design methodology is used to reconfigure this complex for utilizing surplus carbon dioxide. By using a superstructure-based approach, a new design scheme for this industrial ecosystem is proposed. In this paper, an LCA-type environmental impact assessment of different design schemes for this complex is conducted using the software TRACI, a tool developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). This analysis compares various environmental impacts of different designs and identifies the potential trade-offs in different environmental impact categories. This information provides deep insight about the environmental sustainability of industrial ecosystems and facilitates the development of the most eco-effective symbiosis for recycle, reuse and resource conservation.},

This article uses the case of the Dalian Economic and Technological Development Zone (DETDZ) to show how to establish a comprehensive environmental management system (CEMS) according to the ISO 14001 standard at the industrial park level by considering local realities. The particularly interesting feature of this case study is the use of a CEMS (in this case, ISO 14001) by the administrative group of the DETDZ to develop a more comprehensive approach to the wide range of environmental issues that they face in running the zone. In essence the goal is to address many of the issues at the level of the zone. The incentives, benefits, and barriers associated with implementing ISO 14001 are described. However, implementation of an EMS should not be thought of as the ultimate objective for an industrial park’s environmental management. The next steps include encouraging further public participation and taking an integrated approach leading to an industrial ecosystem, which can realize better environmental performance at the industrial park level.},

This paper discusses the notion of entropy and the relationship of entropy to environmental management of industrial activities. In the paper, two case studies of Eco-Industrial Networks are presented: the case of aluminium and that of copper. The analysis of case studies made clear, firstly, that the production of aluminium or copper by recycling new scrap generates significantly less specific entropy than the production of the same product from primary raw materials and, secondly, that the effort of closing the loops of material flows aiming at complete recycling leads to higher generation of specific entropy than those which correspond to the use of primary raw materials. It is proven that there exists an entropy limit of environmental effectiveness when recycling each product. The present paper comments on this limit.},

	abstract = {Eco-industrial park projects have become increasingly popular in China. Because of their rapid proliferation and the lack of accepted and common characteristics, the performance of these projects has been difficult to evaluate. In 2006, the former State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) of China became the first national organization to establish a national standard for eco-industrial parks. This paper aims to explore the applicability and feasibility of the selected indicators. First, it presents the details of this new standard. Second, the feasibility of the new standard is explored by applying the indicators to two industrial zones in China. The benefits and challenges faced in applying the indicators are then discussed in relation to the literature. The analysis demonstrates that the new indicators have a fairly narrow focus on eco-efficiency, rather than a broad objective of ecologically sustainable industrial development. Nevertheless, the Chinese standard is a useful beginning. In future, the authors suggest that this set of indicators be revised to add ecological dimensions that will help promote more sustainable development of industrial parks.},

	title = {Evaluating the success of eco-industrial development},
	abstract = {At the end of the day, a critical question for any new practice, policy or world-view is: how do you measure success? This has been a confusing question in environmental studies, where villains can become heroes and heroes villains according to choices in system boundaries and human understanding of ecological conditions. DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane), for example, is clearly harmful to flora and fauna, and yet some African nations have decided to continue its use as a deterrent for a human scourge: the spread of malaria. Nuclear power, anathema to environmental advocates, is being touted as worth a second look, in part because of the lack of greenhouse-gas emissions in this form of power generation. The analysis paralysis around even small issues—the ponderous debate summarised by the words ‘paper or plastic?’—illustrates the dearth of simple answers and the uncertainty of intuition.

Evaluation of eco-industrial developments (EIDs) has an even more complex cast. Beyond the conventional concerns of project economics and functionality, EIDs include environmental and community considerations that must also be analysed. To be successful, project benefits must outweigh the costs for each firm as well as for the development as a whole. An added responsibility for eco-industrial developers is to show that the newer form of organisation they envision is as good as or preferable to traditional ways of doing business. Tolerance for innovation comes and goes, so there is a great burden on proponents to show that, put under the analytic microscope, both in the planning stage and then in implementation, there are sound reasons and quantifiable benefits to balance the accompanying risks.},

Using a case study of Kawasaki, this paper simulates and evaluates an innovative waste management initiative in Kawasaki by an scenario simulation model based on the LCA approach. Results show that recycling mixed paper, mixed plastics, and organic wastes and utilizing the recycled materials in industrial production will potentially reduce about 69 kt CO2(e) emissions and 8 kt incineration ashes to be landfilled in 2015.

	abstract = {Abstract Circular economy (CE) is key national strategy of China to achieve its long-term sustainable development. Industrial symbiosis (IS) is one practical approach to promote \{CE\} for achieving both environmental and economic benefits simultaneously. Chemical industry has a feature of various material and energy flows and is regarded as one key industry to promote IS. However, quantitative analysis of economic and environmental consequence for \{IS\} activities is still rare, especially for chemical industrial parks in western China. Under such a circumstance, this study is aiming to shed light on the current \{IS\} activities in a typical chemical industrial park in western China, so as to quantitatively evaluate the environmental benefits and economic benefits of IS, including the benefits of each \{IS\} chain, the benefits of each participated industrial company and the total benefits of the whole \{IS\} network in Midong Chemical Industrial Park (MCIP). Results show that: the annual exchanged volume of undesired material from 32 \{IS\} activities in \{MCIP\} was more than 4.74 million tons per year, covering 19 different kinds of undesired materials and involving 18 industrial companies within MCIP. The top four exchanged materials were carbide slag, coal gangue, fly ashes and slag, with the exchanged volumes of 1.07, 0.97, 0.92 and 0.68 million tons per year, respectively. From the perspective of \{IS\} chains, \{IS\} chain number 1 (carbide slag exchange between Huatai Chemical Corp. and Tianshan Cement Corp.) gained the most environmental benefits, with more than 2 million tons and the most economic benefit of 154 million \{RMB\} (25.08 million \{US\} dollar) per year. From the perspective of industrial companies, Huatai Chemical Corp. received the most economic benefits, while Shenhua Thermal Power Plant and Tianshan Cement Corp. received the most environmental benefits. Totally, \{IS\} activities contributed 5.86 million tons of environmental benefits and 382.43 million \{RMB\} (62.29 million \{US\} dollar) of economic benefits to MCIP. In order to further promote \{IS\} in MCIP, several recommendations were proposed, such as increasing \{CE\} awareness and environmental awareness of all the stakeholders, restriction of virgin resources, encouragement of urban symbiosis, establishment of a functional information platform and improvement of CE-related technologies.},

To research the evolution of industrial symbiosis and eco-industrial park construction, and summary the drivers and characteristics of industrial symbiosis development in China, this study uses the National Demonstration Eco-Industrial Park, namely, the Rizhao Economic and Technology Development Area (REDA), as a case study to introduce the industrial symbiosis development process and to research the evolution of industrial symbiosis and eco-industrial park construction, and summarizes the drivers and characteristics of industrial symbiosis development in China. Based on in-depth investigation of enterprises and the government in REDA, three stages (1991–2002, 2003–2006, 2007–2011) of industrial symbiosis development are identified, 31 inter-firms symbiosis performances involving cereal oil and food, machinery, pulp and paper, textile and garment, wine refining, and biochemical industries were formed since REDA was founded in 1991. Results show the environmental benefits of industrial symbiosis performances in 2011, and argue that economic benefits, mainly resulted from stricter environmental standards, tax preference, benefits from material substitution, and financial subsidies, is the critical driver for the stakeholders to participate in industrial symbiosis. The action of governments in industrial symbiosis development is to constituting strict environmental standards, resource comprehensive utilization schemes, financial support and circular economy and eco-industrial park planning guidance. This article provides some unique characteristics of industrial symbiosis growth in a developing country from enterprises and government aspects.},

These are analysed within the context of experiences gained in the early stages of three regional IS programmes under development in the UK, and of the recently launched national IS programme (NISP) that they are part of. It is stated that the policy framework in the UK has elements supportive of such networks to evolve, and the regional public bodies are favouring their development. Based on differences among studied cases, it is argued that the nature of companies' operations and industrial history in the regions, the extent of peer pressure, the positioning of the coordinating body in the region, and its approach to awareness raising and recruitment have major influence on the progress of the programmes. Finally, the paper emphasises the importance of aligning the characteristics of emerging operations with the longer-term sustainability requirements. If accepted, this challenge assigns additional responsibilities to the coordinating parties. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Abstract Industrial ecosystems improve eco-efficiency at the system level through optimizing material and energy flows, which however raises a concern for system resilience because efficiency, as traditionally conceived, not necessarily promotes resilience. By drawing on the concept of resilience in ecological systems and in supply chains, resilience in industrial ecosystems is specified on the basis of a system's ability to maintain eco-efficient material and energy flows under disruptions. Using a network model that captures supply, asset, and organizational dependencies and propagation of disruptions among firms, the resilience, and particularly resistance as an important dimension of resilience, of two real industrial ecosystems and generalized specifications are examined. The results show that an industrial ecosystem is less resistant and less resilient with high inter-firm dependency, preferentially organized physical exchanges, and under disruptions targeted at highly connected firms. An industrial ecosystem with more firms and exchanges is less resistant, but has more eco-efficient flows and potentials, and therefore is less likely to lose its function of eco-efficiency. Taking these determinants for resilience into consideration improves the adaptability of an industrial ecosystem, which helps increase its resilience.},

We propose a simple contract scheme designed to foster the formation of stable industrial symbiosis relationships and to guarantee that the industrial symbiosis is beneficial for all parties involved. Industrial symbiosis networks are framed as complex adaptive systems and an agent-based model is provided, to study the effect of the proposed contract on their emergence. In particular, we utilize a real case study and by means of simulation assess the benefits associated with the proposed contract in terms of emergence of stable industrial symbiosis relationships. The results show that the proposed contractual mechanism is a facilitator for establishing symbiotic relationships especially in scenarios characterized by low environmental uncertainty and high turbulence.},

As such, the tool kit of complex systems science could enrich our understanding of how industrial ecosystems might evolve over time. In this article, I illustrate how an important tool of complex systems science—agent-based simulation—can help to identify those potential elements of an industrial ecosystem that could work together to achieve more eco-efficient outcomes. For example, I show how agent-based simulation can generate cost-efficient energy futures in which groups of firms behave more eco-efficiently by introducing strategically located clusters of renewable, low-emissions, distributed generation. I then explain how role-playing games and participatory modeling can build trust and reduce conflict about the sharing of common-pool resources such as water and energy among small clusters of evolving agents. Collective learning can encourage potential industrial partners to gradually cooperate by exchanging by-products and/or sharing common infrastructure by dint of their close proximity. This kind of coevolutionary learning, aided by participatory modeling, could help to bring about industrial symbiosis.},

	abstract = {Abstract In recent years, the concept of industrial symbiosis (IS) has led to improvements in resource efficiency that may not be possible with individual industrial plants acting independently. One specific aspect is to achieve economies of scale by having multiple companies located in close proximity in order to share common utilities, such as chilled and cooling water. Together, these industrial plants may form an inter-plant chilled and cooling water network (IPCCWN) to achieve greater overall cost savings. Some issues faced by an IPCCWN include network reliability problems due to the consistency of sources' availability, and cost savings allocations for IPCCWN synthesis due to the subjectivity of human preference on decision making. Thus, there exists a need for a decision-making tool to determine a feasible solution that will satisfy all industrial plants in the IPCCWN. In this work, a multi-objective linear programming model is developed to synthesize IPCCWN that achieves maximum cost savings. Next, a Pareto optimal solution is selected using fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) approach. This solution gives the best balance of performance for a set of pre-defined qualitative and quantitative criteria, which is able to account for subjectivity that cannot be addressed from a purely mathematical programming standpoint.},

	abstract = {Abstract Eco-industrial parks provide a platform for the application of industrial symbiosis where the synergistic network of companies reuse portions of their by-products to reduce disposed waste, reduce environmental emissions, and improve plant efficiency. However, designing a complex network of material and energy exchanges between companies in an industrial park while satisfying multiple conflicting objectives require a systematic design methodology. In addition, strategic decision-making in an eco-industrial park involves the selection of prospective companies (i.e., support tenants), which complement the existing companies (i.e., anchor tenants). In this study, a fuzzy mixed-integer non-linear programming model is proposed to select prospective support tenants in an eco-industrial park while satisfying the product demand, minimizing the environmental footprint of the eco-industrial park, and also maximizing the annualized profit of each company in the eco-industrial park. A hypothetical but realistic case study involving an algae-based eco-industrial park is used to demonstrate the application of the model. The results demonstrate the selection of the appropriate support tenants for the algae-based eco-industrial park together with the optimal plant configuration. Sensitivity analysis is used to assess the performance of the algae-based eco-industrial park with respect to the changes in prices of the by-products. The developed model thus aid the planners of an eco-industrial park in assessing which among the prospective support tenants would best complements an existing anchor tenant. Furthermore, the model can also identify price negotiation points between tenants for some product streams which may show sensitivity on the plant capacity of each tenant.},

In addition to water conservation within individual plants, wastewater can be reused/recycled among different companies through inter-plant water integration (IPWI) schemes. Such schemes are based on the concept of industrial ecology and industrial symbiosis, and can be used to achieve greater water savings than when water conservation is implemented in individual companies separately. However, in IPWI, each participating company seeks to maximise its own benefits. In the absence of centralised authority dictating the terms of water integration schemes, conventional modelling techniques are not appropriate.

In this case, the traditional planned economic system of China was the main reason for the existence of the sectoral boundary in HHIE. The sectoral boundary restricted the establishment of potential symbiotic linkages between companies. Going beyond the sectoral boundary was necessary in order to promote industrial ecosystem development. The government played a crucial role in breaking the sectoral boundary. It was “a key stage” in the development of HHIE. Breaking the sectoral boundary was achieved through the approach of establishing a salt-soda combination, i.e., establishing the Hai Hua Group (HHG).

Thus, this paper proposes a review of the role of social media and social networks in order to analyze their ability to stimulate the initiation of industrial synergies. This analysis provides a framework for creating a Web-based industrial synergy support system based on social network-style functionality. For industrial companies and their key stakeholders, this might serve as a system that helps forge partnerships and connections with like-minded others, and ultimately helps discover material flow compatibilities. It could also help post and distribute related information for an entire industry, which could improve the dissemination of knowledge related to industrial ecology. Finally, \{GSN\} could provide researchers interested in exploring the potential of social networks with a new and rich research domain, while bridging both online and offline connections between personal and business sectors.},

This article argues that existing and mature industrial systems provide the best prospects for identifying opportunities for, and ultimately facilitating, industrial symbiosis. Due to levels of diversification and operational fundamental niches that, in the fullness of time, develop within all industrial systems, industrially mature areas are deemed to be industrial symbiosis ‘conducive environments'. Building on the conservation biology concept of a habitat suitability index, the article presents a methodology for comparing a potential site for eco-industrial development to a known baseline industrial ‘habitat' already identified as being highly conducive to industrial symbiosis. The suitability index methodology is further developed and applied to a multi-criteria evaluation geographic information system to produce a ‘habitat' suitability map that allows practitioners to quickly identify potential industrial symbiosis hotspots (the methodology is illustrated for England). The article concludes by providing options for the development of symbiosis suitability indices and how they can be used to support the facilitation of industrial symbiosis and regional resource efficiency.},

In fact, the evolution of industrial symbiosis could be part of a dynamic process leading to the development of a regional industrial ecosystem. Based on a regional context, this paper investigates a three-level approach, i.e., individual firm level, inter-firm level, and regional level, which incorporates cleaner production (CP) and IS to seek potential opportunities for improvement in an operating industrial zone. It was applied in the symbiosis in the Hai Hua Group (HHG) of China. The information was collected through survey questionnaires, open-ended interviews and cleaner production reports from companies. Implementing the three-level approach mainly shows that: (1) all the companies that implemented a cleaner production audit achieved economic and environmental benefits, (2) an existing symbiotic network was discovered, and (3) some potential symbiotic links were identified both at the inter-firm level and the regional level. Integrating cleaner production with industrial symbiosis, the relationship between the industrial symbiosis and its surrounding region, and the role of the government of implementing the three-level approach are discussed. In addition, some barriers were identified and possible resolutions are suggested. It can be concluded that the three-level approach is helpful to integrate CP and IS within a region and provides a useful guidance for discovering industrial symbiosis and promoting its development.},

This article considers ports, understood as platforms of circulation and transformation of material and energy flows. It addresses the role and capacity of ports to foster the implementation of IE in port cities and to contribute to the optimization of resource management in coastal areas. This article presents the result of a research project (2011–2012) consisting of an international inventory of innovative resource management initiatives in port areas. 18 port-based industrial complexes were visited, enabling the analysis of 23 port IE initiatives. Cross-case analysis was carried out following a 3 step methodology: 1/ definition of the research boundaries; 2/ qualitative data collection by means of interviews and a literature review; 3/ data analysis in order to build a typology of port contribution to the implementation of IE in port-city areas. The case studies analyzed can be classified into 9 patterns based on temporal and spatial characteristics of P-IE initiatives. They provide insights on the ports' influence on local IE dynamics: as areas of testing and implementation of industrial symbiosis, ports can constitute exemplary self-sufficient areas, likely to boost the development of other local eco-parks; as drivers of local economic development, ports act as levers for the implementation of sustainable policies at a regional scale; as nodes in a global port network, ports can develop inter-port by-product exchanges and utility sharing. Ports question the relevance of geographical proximity in IE.},

	abstract = {In the production of biofuels for transport many critics have argued about the poor energy efficiency and environmental performance of the production industries. Optimism is thus set on the production of second generation biofuels, while first generation biofuels continue to dominate worldwide. Therefore it is interesting to consider how the environmental performance of first generation biofuel industries can be improved. The field of industrial symbiosis offers many possibilities for potential improvements in the biofuel industry and theories from this research field are used in this paper to highlight how environmental performance improvements can be accomplished. This comes in the form of by-product synergies and utility synergies which can improve material and energy handling. Furthermore, the processes and products can gain increased environmental performance improvements by the adaption of a renewable energy system which will act as a utility provider for many industries in a symbiotic network. By-products may thereafter be upcycled through biogas production processes to generate both energy and a bio-fertilizer. A case study of an actual biofuel industrial symbiosis is also reviewed to provide support for these theories.},

We review the green real-estate development movement occurring globally, and synthesize applicable concepts into a framework called the expanded business operations model (EBOM) to help companies gauge their goal of environmental stewardship. In contrast to the typical flow diagram of a typical business operations model, the EBOM indicates cycling behavior that synergistically enhances each of the four identified categories—Environment, Facilities, Business Synergism, and Green Image. The ultimate goal of these Eco-smart Corporate Communities is to positively impact the local and larger community, while increasing the economic success of property developers and their tenants. We review governmental policies that drive developers toward environmentally friendly techniques, outline tools and programs that assist in the implementation and evaluation of green design plans, and summarize other drivers (i.e., environmental and social issues) that encourage green building and synthesize them into an indicator system for practitioners' reference. Using four independently operated eco-smart corporate communities as case studies, we identify the measures taken to enhance each of the four categories within the framework, and analyze the cascade of impacts. With this framework, it will be possible to set achievable goals that mark reasonable progress in corporate environmental policies.},

	abstract = {Abstract This paper examines the potential for property rights in carbon to affect industrial ecology opportunities. Given that emissions trading schemes for greenhouse gases are becoming more widely implemented, the definition of the carbon property right can affect barriers and opportunities for industrial ecology, alongside other factors. The paper uses legislation for emissions trading in Australia and two possible scenarios for the future of energy generation in the Latrobe Valley, Australia in 2050 as an illustrative case study to identify issues for industrial ecology arising from ill-defined carbon property rights. Currently, electricity generation in the region is reliant on coal-based generators. Scenario one focuses on bio-industries and renewables with no coal usage; and scenario two focuses on electricity from coal with carbon capture and storage resulting in moderate to high coal use. If a carbon property right for soil carbon emerges before a property right for subterranean carbon, then bio-based industrial ecology opportunities could be enabled ahead of a regional symbiosis involving carbon capture and storage. A generalised framework for considering the intersection of industrial ecology and carbon property rights is presented with a focus on tensions in: contributing to sustainable development, system boundaries and finally exchange mechanisms.},

Within the context of such challenges, distinct research branches have emerged: conceptual framework studies, development of operational tools (e.g. design for environment), and systemic studies (e.g. industrial symbiosis). The field began by conceptualizing industrial systems and has now made the transition to gathering the data that characterize such systems. One of the greatest challenges now facing IE is applying the knowledge gleaned from these endeavors to defining and setting goals for sustainable technological activity and development.},

	abstract = {Industrial ecology (IE) studies the physical flows of matter and energy within, and most importantly, between the natural ecosystem and the human industrial system, aiming to reduce the environmental burden of the flows. One of the applications used is to transform the industrial system linear ‘throughput’ material and energy flow that relies on imported non-renewables, on virgin renewables and produces wastes and emissions dumped to nature toward a cyclical and cascading ‘roundput’ flow that relies on local/regional renewables and wastes. The paper constructs a key function or an anchor activity that integrates the throughput material and energy flows and changes them into the roundput model in a local/regional agricultural and food industry system in Finland. This key activity is able to simultaneously utilise and process waste flows from the main steps in the food products' life cycle (value chain) and produce energy and fertiliser to the different processes in the life cycle by using waste as a fuel and as a resource with value. Difficulties in achieving this vision in practice are discussed. The paper uses national data from Finland, regional data from the Satakunta region in southwest Finland and local data from the municipality of Huittinen in Satakunta. A methodology in which environmental, economic and social variables are studied with different ‘what if?’ scenarios for the roundput model and for the throughput model is presented.},

	abstract = {Abstract The supply chain management literature indicates that limited research has explored the roles of Industrial Ecology and Industrial Symbiosis in relation to supply chain environmental sustainability development. Studies have explored supply chain environmental sustainability development and provided different approaches for developing environmentally sustainable supply chains. These include environmental management, design for environment, product stewardship, green purchasing, reverse logistics, recycling, reuse, and remanufacturing. These approaches have often been considered independently. Industrial Ecology and Industrial Symbiosis offer systematic thinking for companies to integrate key elements of these approaches into their supply chain environmental sustainability development. This study aims to develop a conceptual framework to embrace the integration and identify opportunities for companies to work collaboratively. The initial framework was proposed based on the review of the literature associated with environmentally sustainability supply chain management, Industrial Ecology, and Industrial Symbiosis. The initial framework is improved by corroborating the case study company's experience, a large UK distributor. Different hierarchies in waste management have also been considered when developing the framework. The paper emphasises the importance of prevention and reduction methods. The developed framework illustrates the areas and opportunities for supply chain parties to work collaboratively towards environmentally friendly activities. The developed framework contributes to the environmentally sustainable supply chain management literature and encourages companies to apply Industrial Ecology and Industrial Symbiosis to develop their environmentally sustainable supply chains.},

Analogously to a natural ecosystem, the aim is to develop material cycles and energy cascades between local cooperative actors. An optimal resource basis of an industrial ecosystem is the sustainable use of local renewable natural resources. In this paper, we consider the region of North Karelia in Finland, with 19 municipalities, and hence somewhat expand the system boundaries of an industrial ecosystem case study. The current situation and two scenarios of municipal heating energy production are presented. The heating system consists of individual, district and electric heating. The heat production and related greenhouse gas emissions are considered. The current fuel use is based on imported oil and regional fuels (peat, wood wastes). Also, shares for co-production of heat and electricity (CHP) are shown. In scenario one, we assume the majority of the fuel basis in oil and absence of CHP. Scenario two illustrates nearly complete dependence on regional wood wastes and firewood with the current share of CHP. The North Karelia region provides the IE theory with a fruitful case study because the supply of waste fuels and local renewables is vast and waste utilisation technologies (CHP, fluidized bed burning) constitute a significant part of energy production. Implications of the applied scenario approach are discussed in the context of regional decision making and, in particular, for its implementation with the concepts of a regional environmental management system (EMS) and a regional industrial ecosystem management system (RIEMS).},

The research presented here was explicitly normative in its aim to improve the understanding of, and make sustainable change toward highly systemic issues of resource management. The core methods chosen to work toward this aim were bottom up action research procedures (including stakeholder engagement processes) and industrial ecology analysis tools. These methods were employed and tested in pragmatic combination through two of the author's case study projects. The first case study, performed between 2009 and 2012, employed a multi-stakeholder process aimed at improving the cycling of construction and demolition waste in the Stockholm region. The second case study produced a strategic tool (Looplocal) built for facilitating more efficient regional industrial resource networks. While the highly participative aim of the cases required a larger contribution of resources than that of more closed studies, it is arguable that the efficacy of approaching the project aims is improved through their employment.},

	abstract = {Industrial ecology (IE) is a biological concept applied to industrial structures. The basic concepts of IE include regional, intra-firm and product-based waste recycling systems as well as the principle of upward and downward cascading. In best current examples of regional systems, several parties are in an industrial waste re-use symbiosis. Paper industry has learned to arrange the recovery and re-use of its products on distant markets, even up to a level where indications of exceeding optimal recovery and re-use rates already exist through deteriorated fibre and product quality. Such occurrences will take place in certain legislative- economic situations. Paper industry has many cascade levels, each with their internal recovery and recycling, as well as many intra-firm. regional, and life cycle ecology structures. As an example of prospects for individual cascading routes, sludges may continue to be incinerated, but the route to landfills will be closed. The main obstacles of legislative drive toward better IE systems are in many cases existing laws and political considerations rather than economic or technical aspects. The study and practice of engineering human technology systems and related elements of natural systems should develop in such a way that they provide quality of life by aclively managing the dynamics of relevant systems to reduce the risk and scale of undesirable behavior and outcomes. For the paper industry, earth systems engineering offers several development routes. One of them is the further recognition of and research on the fact that the products of the industry are returned back to the carbon cycle of the natural environment. Opportunities for modifying current earth systems may also be available for the industry, e.g. genetically modified plants for raw materials or organisms for making good quality pulp Out of current raw materials. It is to be recognized that earth systems engineering may become a very controversial area, and that very diverse political pressures may determine its future usefulness to the paper industry.},

	abstract = {Industrial ecology represents an emerging interdisciplinary field of studying industrial systems in combination with their fundamental linkage with nature. An eye-catching characteristic at the basis of industrial ecology's scientific profile is its refreshingly unorthodox perspective of understanding nature as model, compared with other disciplines of understanding nature, e.g. in terms of ‘sack of resources’ or ‘biophysical limit’ as opposed to industrial systems. The idea of industrial ecology's appealing perspective is to balance the development of industrial systems with the constraints of natural ecosystems, analogous to an ‘industrial symbiosis’. On the basis of initial efforts to conceptualize industrial ecology's underlying assumptions concerning nature, a philosophically focused approach of its characteristic perspective of understanding nature as model is presented. The contribution may provide industrial ecologists as well as other economists, engineers, scientists and policy-makers involved in the field of sustainability with an opportunity for accessible philosophical reflection, perhaps bringing to the surface their tacit frames regarding nature. Consequently, the goal is to gain greater conceptual clarity and to contribute to laying a solid foundation for industrial ecology's stimulating role when initiating change towards sustainability at large.

Towards this end, the paper first develops industrial ecology as a novel state of the industrial production socio-technical system paying particular attention at its technological component, then it discusses in detail the transition of this system through SNM, and examines whether existing implementations of the industrial ecology (industrial ecosystems and eco-industrial parks) are efforts embracing this philosophy and transition procedures.

In an IE, following the roundput analogy of a natural ecosystem, the industrial actors co-operate by utilising each other's waste material and energy flows and try and reduce the system virgin material and energy input as well as the waste and emission output. In a successful IE, a business-environment win-win might be possible because the raw material and energy costs, waste management costs, costs resulting from environmental legislation, as well as the image costs of the companies in the system and of the system as a whole, can be reduced. In this paper, the IE analogy includes the four basic principles of system development of ecosystems; roundput, diversity, locality and gradual change.

	abstract = {Closing loops by intercompany recycling of by-products is a core theme of industrial ecology (IE). This article considers whether industrial recycling networks or industrial symbiosis projects can be used as a starting point for much broader intercompany cooperation for sustainable development. Evidence presented is based on the results of an empirical investigation of the recycling network Styria in Austria, the recycling network Oldenburger Münsterland in Germany, and the manufacturing sector in Austria. Statistical analysis shows that the percentage of by-products that are passed on to other companies for recycling purposes is not higher in member companies of the recycling networks than in the other companies of the manufacturing sector in Austria. In terms of cooperation, the relationships with the respective recycling partners are found to be very similar to regular customer relations. Furthermore, the companies of the recycling networks remain unaware of the network to which they belong. Instead, one of the main findings of this study is that intercompany recycling activities are regarded by the company representatives as bilateral market transactions, not as collaborative network activities. This has potentially significant implications for the use of industrial symbiosis networks as starting points for sustainability networks with broader cooperation toward sustainability. The findings raise interesting questions as to whether such broader cooperation might result from a conscious planning process or might emerge largely spontaneously as part of normal market coordination. In any case, intercompany recycling is clearly considered to be a very important field of collaborative action for sustainability in industry.},

An important way to improve the environmental performance of these industrial clusters is to quantify, treat, and reduce industrial byproducts. This objective could be achieved through industrial symbiosis or byproduct synergy, terms used for beneficial reuse of materials or energy streams from one facility by another. In the present study an attempt has been made to identify and understand existing and potential industrial symbiosis connections in Muzaffarnagar, an industrial town in north India home to several dozen paper mills, another dozen sugar mills, and a large range of other MSME manufacturing entities. In addition to the presence of small and medium enterprises there is also a strong bond between industry owners in the region.},

	abstract = {Recovery, reuse and recycling of industrial residuals, often dismissed as wastes, are common in India and other industrializing countries largely due to lower associated costs. Some wastes are reused within the facility where they are generated, others are reused directly by nearby industrial facilities, and some are recycled via the formal and informal recycling markets. Direct inter-firm reuse is the cornerstone of the phenomenon termed industrial symbiosis, where firms cooperate in the exchange of material and energy resources. This study applies material flow analysis to an economically diverse industrial area in South India to characterize the recovery, reuse and recycling of industrial residuals. It quantifies the generation of waste materials from 42 companies as well as the materials that are directly traded across facilities and those that are recycled or disposed. This study encompasses a business cluster in Mysore in the State of Karnataka, and is the first in India to thoroughly quantify material flows to identify existing symbiotic connections in an industrial area. Examined industries in this industrial area generate 897,210 metric tons of waste residuals annually, and recovered 99.5\% of these, 81\% with reused by the companies that generated them, with one company, a sugar refinery, processing most of this amount. Geographic data show that operations within 20 km of the industrial area receive over 90\% of residuals exiting facility gates. Two-thirds of this amount goes directly to other economic actors for reuse. This study makes key contributions to the literature in distinguishing how particular types of materials are reused in different ways, the geographic extent of symbiotic activities and the important role of the informal sector in industrial waste management in industrializing regions.},

	abstract = {Abstract Solutions towards sustainable cities are of vital importance for China's stakeholders due to the rapid urbanizations, serious resources depletion and environmental contaminations in China. China as the second largest economy is suffering from the dilemma of rapid industrialization and urbanization, and sustainable development. One of the most severe problems affecting China's sustainable urban development is the resource dependent city, in which resource mining and process industries dominate the local economy. With the depletion of natural resources and the degradation of environment, the concept of sustainability and economy transition solutions become more and more important. Under this condition, this study aims to conduct a comprehensive review on the major projects for a more sustainable future in China's national resource dependent cities and propose a countermeasure for the sustainability transition based on the industrial symbiosis concept. Firstly, an investigation on the panoramic view, challenges, transiting policies of China's resource dependent cities' project has been carried out. Subsequently, Guiyang city in Guizhou province of China, as a typical resource dependent city, has been chosen as example of industrial and regional symbiosis focusing on the integration and symbiosis of coal, electricity, aluminum, phosphor chemical, iron/steel industry and urban. Then, a quantitative assessment on the environmental benefits has been conducted based on material flow analysis approach. Results highlight a dramatic resource saving, solid waste reduction and carbon dioxide emission mitigation, as well as generating revenue for companies and local business opportunities. Finally, policy implications for promoting the industry symbiosis are discussed in details. Our research provides an efficacious solution for the transition of resource dependent cities, and it is revelatory for future sustainable urban planning and policy making in China.},

In particular, organic waste can be used to produce electric energy required by cities. In this way, a resource closed loop is generated, able to reduce the amount of waste disposed of in landfill and the energy purchased from outside the city. We develop a conceptual model that identifies symbiotic flows and processes that generate and receive them. We model these processes using the input-output approach. An efficiency measure of the symbiotic approach within urban areas has been proposed. Finally, we employ three case examples in order to show how the model works. As a result, we provide some useful managerial suggestions for policy makers about the implementation of industrial symbiosis within cities.},

Internally, the GG's complex consists of interlinked production of sugar, alcohol, cement, compound fertilizer, and paper and includes recycling and reuse. Externally, the GG has established a strong customer base as a result of its product quality, has worked to maintain and expand its supply base through technological and economic incentives to farmers (and even to competitors), and has had to react to a strong government presence that fundamentally affects its operations. Operations to date support some of the fundamental concepts of industrial symbiosis.

However, market changes and technological advancement could undermine the level of symbiosis during operations. In this research, the existing symbiosis indicators were identified and classified using a systematic literature review. The results demonstrated the necessity to achieve indicators sufficiently simple that brokers are enabled in confronting the monitoring and promotion of symbiosis. In this paper, an industrial symbiosis indicator is introduced that detects the variation of symbiosis over time and that provides a dynamic perspective of the eco-industrial parks. This indicator can be used in the underpinning of decisions and the provision of continuous improvement. It was evaluated in several theoretical scenarios created from real data. The three scenarios are: absence of symbiosis, presence of symbiosis, and perfect symbiosis. The results demonstrate consistency between the values of the indicator and changes in the scenarios. The industrial symbiosis indicator proposed was able to detect variations in symbiosis with simple measures, and could support managers in encouraging companies to actively engage in effort for more advanced levels of symbiosis. The concept of “environment impact momentum”, proposed and applied in this research, is a theoretical construct that could support a new class of indicators capable of identifying the dynamic behavior of eco-industrial parks.},

In this article some of the central industrial symbiotic exchanges, involving water and steam, in Kalundborg are analyzed, using detailed economic and environmental data. It is found that both substantial and minor environmental benefits accrue from these industrial symbiosis exchanges and that economic motivation often is connected to upstream or downstream operational performance and not directly associated with the value of the exchanged byproduct or waste itself. It is concluded that industrial symbiosis, as viewed from a company perspective, has to be understood both in terms of individual economic and environmental performance, and as a more collective approach to industrial sustainability.},

Industrial symbiosis, a sub-field of industrial ecology, examines the flow of water, energy, materials, and by-products across firms in geographic proximity. Environmentally related co-location benefits often result that have not been a focus of traditional agglomeration economies, but extend the basic theory. This paper conceptualizes the relationship between agglomeration economies and industrial symbiosis, finding that many negative environmental externalities can be reduced while increasing production efficiency. Four industrial regions of Puerto Rico, all with agglomeration economies, but only two with significant industrial symbiosis, highlight the contribution of symbiosis and how it can influence both static and dynamic agglomeration economies.

	abstract = {The realization of regional synergies in industrial areas with intensive minerals processing provides a significant avenue toward sustainable resource processing. This article provides an overview of past and current synergy developments in two of Australia's major heavy industrial regions, Kwinana (Western Australia) and Gladstone (Queensland), and includes a comparative review and assessment of the drivers, barriers, and trigger events for regional synergies initiatives in both areas. Kwinana and Gladstone compare favorably with well-known international examples in terms of the current level and maturity of industry involvement and collaboration and the commitment to further explore regional resource synergies. Kwinana stands out with regard to the number, diversity, complexity, and maturity of existing synergies. Gladstone is remarkable with regard to unusually large geographic boundaries and high dominance of one industry sector. Many diverse regional synergy opportunities still appear to exist in both industrial regions (particularly in Kwinana), mostly in three broad areas: water, energy, and inorganic by-product reuse. To enhance the further development of new regional synergies, the Centre for Sustainable Resource Processing (CSRP), a joint initiative of Australian minerals processing companies, research providers, and government agencies, has undertaken several collaborative projects. These include research to facilitate the process of identifying and evaluating potential synergy opportunities and assistance for the industries with feasibility studies and implementation of selected synergy projects in both regions. The article also reports on the progress to date from this CSRP research.},

	abstract = {The Kwinana Industrial Area of Western Australia has emerged as a world leading example of industrial symbiosis. This involves businesses in close proximity exchanging by-product material, water and energy. Utilisation of a previously discarded resource as an alternative input to another company can help improve both business and sustainability performance of the participating companies. For example, the exchange can reduce disposal costs and provide a cheaper input for the receiving company. The environmental benefits can include reduced collective resource consumption and waste generation, whilst the social benefits may include new employment opportunities and reduction of emission (e.g. water or traffic) to the local community.
This article presents the integrated research programme undertaken at the Centre of Excellence in Cleaner Production, Curtin University of Technology which seeks to enhance the uptake of industrial symbiosis in Australian heavy industrial areas. The case of Kwinana is discussed with illustrative case studies of industrial symbiosis exchanges.

	abstract = {Abstract The environmental crisis affecting the Taranto provincial industrial district in Italy, centred around the Ilva steelworks, has made its existence within the surrounding contexts unsustainable. The application of industrial symbiosis principles in this district can certainly represent a purposeful means for a move towards a more sustainable industrial system. This work presents the results of a research project, funded by the Caripuglia Foundation, for a study of industrial symbiosis in the Taranto industrial district. The study of the district, which is characterized by the presence of heavy industries such as steelworks, oil refinery, cement industry and power stations with an energy consumption of 182.4 PJ/year, identified the industrial sectors and firms that could be involved in symbiotic activities and the spontaneous existing synergic interactions taking place among the largest firms of the district. The study has also quantified and illustrated the useful recycling, within various industrial sectors, of inefficiently used and disposed waste energy (44.6 PJ/year of heat) and material waste and by-products (3.28 Mt/year). Among the latter are steelworks slag, mill scale, spent refractories and coal fly ash. However, the study has revealed that, despite the presence of multiple anchor tenants on the territory, the industrial symbiosis is still implemented at a basic level. There are different constraints on the full development of the industrial symbiosis in the industrial district of Taranto. Among these, the focus of the entrepreneurs on their core business was the main one, while additional uses of the current waste are seen as a diversion of human resources and capital.},

Following a generic review of technical, political, economic, informational, and organisational factors that can have major influences on the development and functioning of IS networks and the role of coordination bodies aiming to catalyse the system developments, major political and institutional elements relevant to IS developments and applicable to all three regions are outlined. Experiences from individual IS programmes are then shared and analysed in light of technical, informational and organisational factors and the attributes of coordination bodies. Such analyses indicate the dominating importance of the organizational factors such as the history of industrial development, intensity of social interactions among relevant parties, and their mental proximity. Experiences also reveal that the perception of regional parties about the coordinating bodies is influential on the effectiveness of development efforts. A set of recommendations drawn from the analysis is intended to inform further similar efforts under National Industrial Symbiosis Programme (NISP). The paper concludes by highlighting the need of aligning the functioning of emerging networks with the requirements of longer term sustainability, which imposes higher challenges on coordination bodies.},

Industrial symbiosis engages traditionally separate industries in a collective approach to competitive advantage involving physical exchange of materials, energy, water, and/or by-products. The keys to industrial symbiosis are collaboration and the synergistic possibilities offered by geographic proximity. This paper reviews the small industrial symbiosis literature and some antecedents, as well as early efforts to develop eco-industrial parks as concrete realizations of the industrial symbiosis concept. Review of the projects is organized around a taxonomy of five different material exchange types. Input-output matching, stakeholder processes, and materials budgeting appear to be useful tools in advancing eco-industrial park development. Evolutionary approaches to industrial symbosis are found to be important in creating the level of cooperation needed for multi-party exchanges.},

	abstract = {In order to stabilize the global climate, the world's governments must make significant commitments to drastically reduce global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. One of the most promising methods of curbing GHG emissions is a world transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy. Solar photovoltaic (PV) cells offer a technically sustainable solution to the projected enormous future energy demands. This article explores utilizing industrial symbiosis to obtain economies of scale and increased manufacturing efficiencies for solar PV cells in order for solar electricity to compete economically with fossil fuel-fired electricity. The state of PV manufacturing, the market and the effects of scale on both are reviewed. Government policies necessary to construct a multi-gigaWatt PV factory and complementary policies to protect existing solar companies are outlined and the technical requirements for a symbiotic industrial system are explored to increase the manufacturing efficiency while improving the environmental impact of PV. The results of the analysis show that an eight-factory industrial symbiotic system can be viewed as a medium-term investment by any government, which will not only obtain direct financial return, but also an improved global environment. The technical concepts and policy limitations to this approach were analyzed and it was found that symbiotic growth will help to mitigate many of the limitations of PV and is likely to catalyze mass manufacturing of PV by transparently demonstrating that large-scale PV manufacturing is technically feasible and reaches an enormous untapped market for PV with low costs.},

	abstract = {Abstract In this paper we present the potential for small and medium sized enterprises grouped in industrial areas or parks for systemic eco-innovation through industrial symbiosis strategies. The study was carried out in an industrialised region in the self-governing region of Cantabria (Northern Spain), which comprises 161 inventoried firms, located in 9 different industrial areas. By sectors, 40\% work in commerce, the repair of motor vehicles, motorbikes and motorcycles and personal and domestic articles, 16\% in metallurgy and the manufacture of metallic products, 13\% in construction and the remaining 31\% work in such diverse sectors as real estate services, the paper industry, food and the chemical industry, among others. The information on resources and waste flows was collected by means of programmed visits, with a success rate of 104/161 enterprises. The preliminary results show opportunities both for substituting resources with waste products in real and virtual cases and for sharing waste management services and infrastructures. The diversity of synergetic opportunities is related to the number of enterprises that participate in each industrial area and with the occurrence of the types of waste products in the global system; thus we find options for action on different systemic levels. An optimistic scenario for escalating industrial symbiosis between small and medium sized enterprises is revealed from the project, thanks to both the companies' current behaviour and to the potential opportunities that were detected. This paper establishes the basis for advancing in subsequent stages of quantification and the evaluation of the feasibility of specific alternatives for turning the system under study into an industrial ecosystem.},

Le Havre is a city located in the north-western France, which concentrates more than a third of French refining capacity. However, simultaneously, the pollution caused by industries needs to be controlled. Furthermore, Le Havre would like to be the first city that does really ecological industrial park in France. Industrial symbiosis is a key concept of industrial ecology, which studies the physical flows of materials and energy in the local industrial systems. There are few studies that support the assumption of economic and environmental benefits of industrial symbiosis. So, in order to have a WIN-TO-WIN situation, we proposed a mathematical optimization control model. The model will help the manufacturing industries to reduce related costs, and the negative environmental impact would be decreased simultaneously. Best to our knowledge, currently, it does not exist any other general mathematical optimization model for constructing and optimizing an eco-industrial park.},

In this article we analyze those generally used terms for their connection to the ecological metaphor that is the root of industrial ecology, and their varied interpretations in IS research and practice over time. We then propose an updated definition intended to communicate the essence of IS as a tool for innovative green growth: IS engages diverse organizations in a network to foster eco-innovation and long-term culture change. Creating and sharing knowledge through the network yields mutually profitable transactions for novel sourcing of required inputs and value-added destinations for non-product outputs, as well as improved business and technical processes.We posit that, although geographic proximity is often associated with IS, it is neither necessary nor sufficientnor is a singular focus on physical resource exchange},

	abstract = {Despite the fact that all successful, documented cases of industrial symbiosis to this day have been self-organizing, some authors and development officials have suggested that increased public planning might deliver better results in this respect than spontaneously evolved market coordination. This paper takes an historical approach to suggest that comprehensive planning is unlikely to live up to the expectations of its proponents. The essay is structured as follows. The first section provides short case studies of industrial symbiosis in highly different economic and institutional settings, the essentially free-market regime of Victorian England and communist Hungary (1948–1989). The available evidence suggests that market coordination proved much more favorable to the emergence of industrial symbiosis, despite the elaboration of a comprehensive policy to that effect in Hungary. Insights derived from the so-called “Austrian” critique of central planning are then used to explain this paradox. The analysis presented suggests that the Hungarian planners' failure was not so much the result of the bad implementation of sound policies, but the logical outcome of a top-down approach's shortcomings. Policy implications for the public planning of industrial symbiosis in a mixed economy are then derived and the case for self-organization is found more compelling. The creation of more innovative institutions that will force firms to “internalize their externalities” while leaving them the necessary freedom to innovate is viewed as an urgently needed and promising path towards increased, sustainable reuse of industrial by-products.},

District Heating System (DHS) using waste heat is highlighted as an attractive solution. However, because of low heat demand in urban areas and the geographic separation of industries, popularizing this solution is considerably difficult in Japan. Previous studies have focused on technical improvements on existing district heating networks, but these studies lack sufficient discussion on an early-stage integrated land-use planning. Supported by technological assessment and emerging concepts of Industrial-Urban Symbiosis (I-US), this study combines the system development of \{DHS\} and land use scenarios into a symbiotic design based on inventory survey and geographic database, and conducts a cost-benefit analysis to scientifically and quantitatively evaluate the effects brought from land-use policies. Results from a case study of Shinchi Town in the Fukushima Prefecture indicate \{DHS\} using waste heat can realize significant benefits of energy saving and \{CO2\} reduction, provided positive guidance on land use planning is implemented. Moreover, the model framework of this study also supports a quantitative assessment on policy implementation to help in decision making on urban sustainable energy planning.},

Exploring the evolution of \{IS\} is crucial to present a dynamic perspective of IS. This paper highlights the drivers and the mechanism of policies on the evolution of \{IS\} as well as the environmental benefits of IS. A backward approach that provides comprehending on how industrial network emerged over time was used to analyze the sequences of \{IS\} in a typical case study of an iron and steel industrial network from 1958 to 2012. Results show that symbiotic links increased from 2 to 75 over time, with the average number of symbiotic links per entities from 1 to 3.26. The main guiding factors in the evolution of industrial symbiosis are not only the interests of enterprises and knowledge of industrial symbiosis, but also related policies and regulations. Industrial symbiosis can improve carbon metabolism efficiency and avoid pollutants emissions. Exchange-based \{IS\} can avoid more carbon dioxide emission (CO2) than the other pollutants, and energy exchanges had a greater contribution to pollutants emission reduction than the solid waste/byproduct exchanges. The network structure and the evolution of \{IS\} can be understood better through considering not only the inter-firm level and the regional or global level but also the intra-firm level.},

Optimizing materials and energy flows among facilities within specific regions or industrial ecosystems is a basic industrial ecology strategy. As such, life cycle analysis and management and green supply chain management are related approaches. The Guitang Group, a Chinese sugar complex, has developed an embryonic eco-industrial development by applying an integrated approach to green supply chain management. This paper describes the Guitang Group and its evolving integrated green supply chain management model. After summarizing experiences of the application of the Group’s model, the paper analyzes challenges and then introduces possible solutions. Some conclusions are developed on the basis of this analysis.},

	abstract = {Many anthropogenically-produced or beneficiated materials contained in “end-of-life” products retain a great proportion of the invested manufacturing work when discarded. Very few such materials are reconstituted and applied in new products at the same material inherent quality level as in their first lifetime – a process known as “closed-loop recycling”. In general, industrial society maintains an extract, expend, expel modus operandi despite demonstrated “loop closure” feasibility for a significant number of materials. This thesis builds from a foundation in Industrial Ecology, a field prescribing to an ecological metaphor for how paradigmatic change might take place towards closure of material-energy cycles. It utilises three detailed case studies of loop closure work to develop a conceptual framework describing behaviour of industrial actors when faced with the opportunity, or need, to innovate for material cycle closure. This work helps answer questions about why work towards closure for “promising” material cycles may not be progressing, where key barriers lie, and how measures might be implemented to encourage the evolution of industrial conduct towards more widespread closed-loop recycling.},

This study illustrates (i) the synthesis and design of an interfactory and intrafactory water network system for an eco-industrial park (EIPWNS) utilizing more opportunities for water reuse within an industrial park, and (ii) an environmental and economic feasibility study to demonstrate benefits from industrial symbiosis. An EIPWNS is synthesized, designed, and compared to a conventional water system (CWS). The feasibility study using life cycle assessment and life cycle costing shows that the total environmental impacts of the EIPWNS are 7.5\% to 16.0\% less than those of the CWS, and the life cycle cost of the EIPWNS is 15.6\% less. Therefore, the EIPWNS can be employed in remodeling a conventional industrial park to an eco-industrial park. This study provides a good example for disseminating EIPWNSs.},

	abstract = {Recovering energy from wastes is a useful strategy for integrated waste and energy management in an eco-industrial park (EIP) and gives promising reduction of wastes, total energy consumption and operation cost. In Jinqiao EIP, Pudong New Area, Shanghai, an industrial symbiosis, based on the energy recovery from municipal sewage sludge and re-refined oil, was proposed in the central heat-supplying company of Jinqiao EIP. It is expected that hot off-gas or part of the steam from the central heat-supplying company could be used for sludge drying and used oil re-refining while the dried sludge and refined oil can be partial substitution for fossil fuel. For the purpose of assessing the environmental performance of this industrial symbiosis, life cycle assessment (LCA) was used and different scenarios were set up in this study to evaluate the Global warming Potential (GWP), Acidification Potential (AP), Eutrophication Potential (EP), Human toxicity air (HTA) and Total Environmental Impact Potential (TEIP) of the system. Results indicate that when the substitute ratio of coal by sludge is 14\%, the proposed industrial symbiosis has the least environmental impact. Compared with the current situation (sludge is landfilled), co-combustion of dried sludge and re-refined oil with coal at optimal scale will release less CO2, CH4, NOx, N2O and CO, but more SO2, H2S, NH3, HCl, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) and heavy metals.},

	abstract = {Abstract The scale of industry clusters and their significant environmental impact make addressing environmental strategies on the cluster level an intriguing task. Although several studies indicate that upstream processes contribute significantly to the total environmental impact of the system, few studies assess how environmental strategy development can be approached from a life cycle perspective. The aim of this paper was to investigate the practical significance of life cycle-based environmental strategy development using a chemical industry cluster in Sweden as the case study. To assess the environmental impact, a cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment (LCA) was chosen as the method, with the total annual production of the cluster in 2011 as the functional unit. To cover the whole value chain, the global warming potential for downstream processes was also estimated. The findings were linked to the cluster vision, which aims to reduce environmental impact by 2030. The results indicate that the cluster must focus on the whole value chain when pursuing the aim of producing sustainable products as environmental impact both upstream and downstream of the cluster accounts for a larger share than on-site processes. The assessment also enables distribution of environmental impact among incoming material streams, thus providing the cluster with decision support when introducing renewable and recycled materials. Additionally, the assessment supports strategy comparison and serves as a base case against which strategy opportunities can be evaluated. This study demonstrates that the life cycle approach has interesting potential to support industry cluster companies in their mutual effort to improve environmental performance.},

In recent years, some limits may be expressed mainly due to the persistent and growing global competition. Industrial Ecology (IE) proposes more sustainable models for the local development, mainly in the form of the so-called Eco-Industrial Parks (EIPs). This article analyses, in the framework of IE, the Ecologically Equipped Industrial Area (EEIA); introduced in 1998 by a national law, it currently represents the most significant model for the sustainable local industrial development in Italy. In the first part of the article, the place-based approaches to \{IE\} are described, highlighting the potential of the \{EIPs\} model and the delay in its diffusion within the Italian contexts. In the second part, the article examines the concept and the main features of the EEIAs, as defined by the national and regional regulations, and their role in the evolution of the \{LISes\} towards the \{EIP\} model. The results highlight that the main potential and limits of the \{EEIAs\} model are respectively related to i) the centralised management of the services, spaces and systems, the shared infrastructures and services within the area, and the administrative simplifications for the companies involved; ii) the long time investments returns, the regulatory limits related to the exchange of wastes, and an excessive inflexibility of the top-down approach followed in its development.},

Existing researches concerning low carbon development of industrial park mainly focus on carbon accounting and carbon reduction strategies. Explanation of how the activities are designed and practiced according to characteristics of targeted industrial parks is limited. Thus, it is essential to have a close look at the low carbon innovation and practice in industrial park. In this study, low carbon practice in Caohejing Industrial Park is targeted as a case study. Low carbon development ideas and actions in the general scope and particular actions are respectively examined. In terms of the general scope, measures including optimization of the energy structure, transforming of infrastructure and auditing of energy consumption and \{GHG\} emission are found well practiced. As for the particular action, approaches of industry symbiosis and energy saving in the building sector are analyzed. The contribution of \{GHG\} emission reduction approaches in Caohejing Industrial Park is then evaluated. Our findings reveal that transparent accounting of \{GHG\} emissions is a basic work for carrying out low carbon measures. Energy structure optimization, infrastructure transforming are also essential steps in the general scope. The commonly applied industry symbiosis is found effective in promoting low carbon economy together with energy saving efforts in the building sector. The experience of regional industrial development in our research can offer reference for low carbon development of industrial parks in helping to make the necessary changes towards sustainable post fossil carbon societies.},

These companies have many opportunities to improve on these aspects and the indicators can measure and reflect their evolution.

A large-scale coal-mining group is studied empirically as a case to explain the framework of interdependency analysis among the industrial chains. The results display high degree of interdependency between production costs and marketing costs, and low degree of that between revenues and profits, which means high controllability of material flows within IS network and low controllability of sales, marketing.

	abstract = {In view of recent studies of the historical development and current status of industrial symbiosis (IS), life cycle assessment (LCA) is proposed as a general framework for quantifying the environmental performance of by-product exchange. Recent guidelines for LCA (International Reference Life Cycle Data System [ILCD] guidelines) are applied to answer the main research questions in the IS literature reviewed. A typology of five main research questions is proposed: (1) analysis, (2) improvement, and (3) expansion of existing systems; (4) design of new eco-industrial parks, and (5) restructuring of circular economies. The LCA guidelines were found useful in framing the question and choosing an appropriate reference case for comparison. The selection of a correct reference case reduces the risk of overestimating the benefits of by-product exchange. In the analysis of existing systems, environmentally extended input-output analysis (EEIOA) can be used to streamline the analysis and provide an industry average baseline for comparison. However, when large-scale changes are applied to the system, more sophisticated tools are necessary for assessment of the consequences, from market analysis to general equilibrium modeling and future scenario work. Such a rigorous application of systems analysis was not found in the current IS literature, but would benefit the field substantially, especially when the environmental impact of large-scale economic changes is analyzed.},

	abstract = {Industrial symbiosis promises environmental and economic gains through a utilization of the waste of some processes as a resource for other processes. Because of the costs and difficulties of transporting some wastes, the largest theoretical potential for industrial symbiosis is given when facilities are colocated in an eco-industrial park (EIP). This study proposes a model-centered approach with an eight-step procedure for the early planning and design of an eco-industrial park considering technical and environmental factors. Chemical process simulation software was used to model the energy and material flows among the prospective members and to quantify the benefits of integration among different firms in terms of energy and resources saved as compared to a reference situation. Process simulation was based on a combination of physical models of industrial processes and empirical models. The modeling allows for the development and evaluation of different collaboration opportunities and configurations. It also enables testing chosen configurations under hypothetical situations or external conditions. We present a case study around an existing oil and gas refinery in Mongstad, Norway. We used the approach to propose the colocation of a number of industrial facilities around the refinery, focused on integrating energy use among the facilities. An EIP with six main members was designed and simulated, matching new hypothetical members in size to the existing operations, modeling material and energy flows in the EIP, and assessing these in terms of carbon and hydrogen flows.},

	abstract = {Abstract Nowadays, industrial symbiosis is a key concept of industrial ecology, which studies material and energy exchange flows in the local industrial systems to reduce the costs, e.g., the wastes treatment cost, and to reduce the pollution, e.g., greenhouse gas emissions. An industrial park is a set of manufacturing businesses producing different products and by-products located at the same place (city, region, etc.). As the concept of this model encourages the development of synergy and leverage of resource networks, to the advantage of all of the enterprises present in an industrial park, a general mathematical model has been proposed. The aims of this general model are: to maximize total quantity of exchanges flows, to maximize total economic benefice of an industrial park, and to reduce relative environmental pollution, industrial waste treatment cost and delivery cost. This model can assure a win-win situation for industries and environment. There are rigorous mathematical models for specific ecological industrial parks [1]. To the best of our knowledge, there is no currently other general mathematical model for designing and optimizing an ecological industrial park. In addition, there is no currently complete ecological industrial park in France.},

Among other things, the potential roles of a municipality in regionally oriented environmental management and development planning have to be further analysed. In this paper, MEM is confronted with the concept of industrial ecology (IE). In particular, the role of a municipality in developing regional industrial ecology, and, vice versa, the role of regional industrial ecology in developing MEM, will be reflected upon. It is argued that a municipality, serving as an institutional anchor tenant, may provide the regional IE effort with the needed institutional support. In return, regional IE seems to have the potential to provide a basis for increased co-operation between public and private actors of a region as well as integration of regional environmental and development issues.

	abstract = {In a recent paper, a generic model, based on a multiobjective optimization procedure, for water supply system for a single company and for an eco-industrial park was proposed and illustrated by a park involving three companies A, B and C. The best configuration was identified by simultaneously minimizing the fresh water flow rate, the regenerated water flow rate and the number of connections in the eco-industrial park. The question is now to know what the maximal increase/decrease in pollutant flow rates is, so that the eco-industrial park remains feasible, economically profitable and environmentally friendly. A preliminary study shows that the park can accept an increase of pollutant flow rates of 29\% in company A, 12\% in company B and only 1\% in company C; beyond these limits the industrial symbiosis becomes not feasible. The proposed configuration is not flexible with a very limited number of connections. Indeed, the solution implemented for conferring some flexibility to this network is to increase the number of connections within the park. However, connections have a cost, so the increase of their number needs to remain moderate. The number of connections is augmented until the symbiosis becomes unfeasible, or until the gain for each company to participate to the park becomes lower than a given threshold. Several cases are studied by increasing the pollutant flow rates under two different scenarios: 1) in only one company, 2) in two or three companies simultaneously.},

The authors of this paper argue that unlike the usual way of applying industrial ecology as a technical tool or a practical instrument, ADCs need to adopt industrial ecology as a strategic vision and as a strategic approach to plan the economic, social and ecological development of their national economies. In this way, it can be possible for the ADCs to avoid the same problems that occurred when the developed countries experienced industrialization and rapid economic growth, and move toward more sustainable development.},

	abstract = {Abstract With the growing environmental concern, there is evidence that increasing symbiotic relationship between plants in the same industrial area, highly contributes to a more sustainable development of industrial activities. The concept of industrial ecology extended to the terms of eco-industrial park (or ecopark) or industrial symbioses is the topic of extensive research since the five last years. More particularly, even if a lot of ecopark examples and realizations already exist throughout the world, a lot of ecopark proposals are in progress but not achieved. Recently, this vision leads the research community to focus on works proposing methods to optimize the exchanges of an ecopark prior to its design and construction. We find it especially interesting for the scientific community to propose a detailed paper review focused on optimization works devoted to the design of eco industrial parks. This paper is based on a comprehensive literature search in Web of Science database for publications that listed ‘industrial symbiosis' (or ‘eco industrial park', or ‘inter plant integration') and ‘optimization'. This study is segmented into different sections with first, a description of the different concepts evoked in the literature. Then, the several types of networking in an eco-industrial park are detailed in association with the optimization methods employed to solve each problem. The following sections reviews the different objective functions that are formulated to optimally design an eco-industrial park. The last part of the paper is devoted to a critical analysis of the state of the art by proposing several routes to improve the methodologies found in the literature. Another aim of this paper review consists in finding the gaps existing in previous studies. These major gaps are found to be: the lack of multiobjective optimization studies, the absence of social/societal objectives formulation also needs to be addressed and the lack of works taking into account flexibility of ecoparks in an operational point of view.},

	abstract = {Abstract The variety of successful and unsuccessful eco-industrial parks (EIPs) have evoked a discussion on “how to intervene in the process of transforming an industrial park to an eco-industrial park”. This study presents a process analysis approach that enables analysts to trace and structure the key activities that influence changes in an EIP system. This approach rests on five key activities that affect EIP changes and development: (1) institutional activity (2) technical facilitation (3) economic and financial enablers (4) informational activity and (5) company activity. Applying this lens to a Chinese EIP, Tianjin Economic-technological Development Area (TEDA), allowed us to build a structured database of activities to analyze its eco-transformation. In TEDA, institutional activity shapes the institutional arrangements that are pivotal for enabling and shaping the eco-transformation. Company activity has less influence on the system than the other key activities. Informational activity is vital to build trust and relationships. In a long time-span, TEDA transformed from a planned EIP to a planned and facilitated EIP, where the local authority acts as a coordinator and as a facilitator. The process analysis approach is amenable for an institutional environment other than the Chinese context because it results in a structured and documented analysis that is open to adjustment, expansion and critique.},

An urban-level hybrid physical input and monetary output (HPIMO) model which covers physical energy inputs and air pollutants emissions, is established for addressing case study in a Chinese typical industrial city (Liuzhou). Based on current energy consumption and industrial symbiosis and the application of HPIMO model, scenarios related to industrial symbiosis, including waste plastics recycling, scrap tires recycling, flying ash recycling and biomass utilization are explored. Results show that compared with business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, IS can reduce solid wastes and further contribute to the co-benefits of energy saving, CO2 emissions reduction and air pollutants reduction. The finding is critical for national low-carbon strategy. Finally, policy implications to support the ever-improvement of IS promotion in China are proposed and discussed.},

Such transformation, however, requires methodologies and tools that support and facilitate the process. This paper proposes an analytical model that favours the redesign of industrial areas based on sustainable strategies for eco-industrial parks. The proposed model is enhanced by the definition of building blocks of an agent-based modelling method. The methodology that was followed favours the detailed description of the objectives of the system, with individual elements and adaptation to the surrounding environment, amongst other features. The proposed model integrates a knowledge database that supports the process of identification of cooperative strategies such as material exchange networks in industrial areas. The underlying theory for the assessment of cooperative interactions is game theory, which supports the resolution of problems with strategic choices. This work covers the stage of analytical model formulation that is essential for advancement towards the inference process based on simulation models.},

While industrial symbiosis is seen hypothetically as a win-win situation, there are few analyses of the economic and environmental consequences for the individual participants in multi-faceted exchanges. In this article, the nascent industrial symbiosis network in Guayama, Puerto Rico, is explored from environmental, economic, and regulatory perspectives of the individual participants and the community. A coal-fired power plant, owned and operated by the AES Corporation, draws five million gallons per day of process water from nearby sources thus avoiding freshwater withdrawals and, through steam sales, significantly reduces emissions from a nearby refinery. This article quantifies economic and environmental costs and benefits for the symbiosis participants, concluding that there are substantial benefits to engaging in symbiosis, although these benefits fall unevenly on participating organizations. Policy intervention can be a viable means of motivating more regular occurrences of resource exchanges among groups of firms.},

By conducting a statistical analysis of synergies facilitated by the United Kingdom's National Industrial Symbiosis Programme during their first five years of operation, this article attempts to quantify geographic proximity and in the process provide practitioners with an insight into the movement trends of different waste streams. Among other it was found that the median distance materials travelled within a symbiotic relationship is 20.4 miles. It is argued that quantitative information of this form is of practical value for the effective deployment of industrial symbiosis practitioners and wider resource efficiency planning. The results and discussion presented within this article are specific to industrial symbiosis opportunities facilitated within the United Kingdom; the methodology and assessment of resource movement influences are, however, expected to be relevant to all countries in which industrial activity is similarly mature and diversified.},

Nonhazardous industrial waste is a high volume flow principally constituted of wastewater with some solid materials. The state of Pennsylvania produced some 20 million metric tons of these residual wastes in 2004. An innovative reporting requirement for industrial generators implemented and compiled by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection has resulted in a rich database collected since 1992 of residual waste generation, detailing the fate of more than 100 materials. By combining these records with life cycle inventory (LCI) data, the current and potential environmental benefits of residual waste use have been assessed. Results for Pennsylvania indicate a savings in 2004 of 13 PJ of primary energy, 0.9 million metric tons of CO2eq, 4300 tons of SO2eq, and 4200 tons of NOx emissions from reuse of residual wastes. While these energy savings constitute less than 1\% of total industrial primary energy use in the state, it is a greater quantity of energy than that generated by the state’s renewable energy sector. The framework and constraints surrounding reuse of residual waste in Pennsylvania are discussed.},

Local co-operation in industrial symbioses can reduce raw material use and waste disposal, but material and energy flows extending outside symbiosis boundaries can cause considerable environmental impacts. These external impacts are often ignored in industrial symbiosis studies. In this study, we compared process, hybrid and input−output life cycle assessment (LCA) approaches in quantifying the overall environmental impacts of a forest industrial symbiosis, situated in Kymenlaakso, Finland. Conclusions from an earlier process-LCA were strengthened by the use of hybrid-LCA as local emissions were found to cause less than half of the global impacts. In some impact categories, the whole impact was caused by supply chain emissions (land use, metal depletion and ozone depletion). The cutoff in process-LCA was found to be less than 25\%, except in metal depletion and terrestrial ecotoxicity. Input−output LCA approximated hybrid-LCA results well in most impact categories, but seriously underestimated land use and overestimated terrestrial ecotoxicity. Based on the results we conclude, that input−output based LCA can be used to analyze the global impacts of an industrial symbiosis, but a careful interpretation of the results is necessary in order to understand the influence of aggregation and allocation.},

	abstract = {Abstract By strengthening material metabolism among collocated enterprises in leading industrial production chains in eco-industrial parks (EIPs), an industrial symbiosis (IS) system can be constructed, which is effective in strengthening the circular economy (CE). It has become important for EIPs to quantitatively evaluate the CE performance of the production chain while also seeking specific measures that could promote resources utilization efficiency. In this paper, we combine the substance flow analysis (SFA) approach with the resource productivity (RP) indicator to evaluate the contribution of IS to the development of circular economy. Through questionnaires and field surveys of key enterprises in Suzhou New District (SND), a substance flow analysis and resource productivity indicator were developed for core materials (copper, water and energy) in printed circuit boards (PCB) production under the excluding waste utilization scenario and including waste utilization scenario. The results show that the RPCu of chain from electrolytic copper production enterprises (ECPE) to electrolytic copper foil production enterprises is respectively 21.38 and 23.15 thousand yuan per ton, from ECPE to copper clad laminate (CCL) production enterprises is respectively 64.15 and 71.32 thousand yuan per ton, and from ECPE to PCB production enterprises is respectively 176.47and 211.21 thousand yuan per ton under the two scenarios. RP is enhanced by prolonging the industrial production chain and the RP under the excluding waste utilization scenario is higher than the including waste utilization scenario for the same chain, which can be achieved through greater IS. Finally we propose further implications on developing CE in EIPs.},

This article provides a complimentary case study for Kawasaki, Japan. The 14 documented symbioses connect steel, cement, chemical, and paper firms and their spin-off recycling businesses. Seven key material exchanges divert annually at least 565 000 tons of waste from incineration or landfill. Four of these collectively present an estimated economic opportunity of 13.3 billion JPY (∼130 million USD) annually. Five symbioses involve utilization of byproduct and two sharing of utilities. The others are traditional or new recycling industries that do not specifically benefit from geographic proximity. The synergistic effect of urban and industrial symbiosis is unique. The legislative framework for a recycling-oriented society has contributed to realization of the symbioses, as has the availability of government subsidies through the Eco-Town program.},

As one of the first and the best-known eco-town projects, Kawasaki Eco-town was chosen as a case study area. First, the current industrial symbiosis practices in this area are introduced. To evaluate the potential of reducing the total CO2 emission through industrial symbiosis, alternative industrial symbiosis scenarios are then designed based on a questionnaire survey of 57 major local industries, to which 35 companies appropriately responded. The main focus of this paper is to calculate the total CO2 emission for different scenarios by adopting a life cycle CO2 analysis method. We then present recommendations on further improvement with consideration of the local realities. Our findings are that industrial symbiosis practices in Kawasaki Eco-town still have room for improvement in that greenhouse gas emissions can be further reduced and natural resources conserved through effective material exchanges, not only between companies, but also with the surrounding area. To encourage material exchanges between the municipality and industry, the city government should introduce a detailed separation program for garbage collection so that wastes can be effectively reused. In addition, the Waste Disposal and Public Cleaning Law needs amending so that industries can effectively use municipal solid waste in their manufacturing.},

	abstract = {Abstract The forest products industry generates several residues in addition to actual products and many of these residues such as fly ash generated by bioenergy production and sludge from the waste water purification processes can be used after being properly treated. This study focused on a hypothetical case in which fly ash from bioenergy production and sludge from forest products industry waste water treatment would be granulated and produced into a forest fertilizer. The Waste Policy of the European Union and growing focus on circular economy goals both support more efficient use of industrial waste and side products and is a major driver for companies towards better material efficiency. This study assessed the global warming potential (GWP) of a potential symbiosis product based on a hypothetical granulating process including two industrial residue streams and briefly examined the drivers of the \{EU\} and Finnish policy and legal frameworks for recycling of industrial residues and for their usage as secondary raw materials for potential symbiosis products. The results indicated that the production of 1000 kg of potential symbiosis granules in our model case produced \{GWP\} burdens of 11.75 (kg CO2-equiv.). As an example, the production of the already existing NPK-fertilizers produced a \{GWP\} burden of 1304.92 (kg CO2-equiv.). Our system boundary was the actual manufacturing process. We also compared different fertilizers based on their fertilizer effect including determination of the composition of the elements in relation to the commercial fertilizer composition. The results indicate that even if the amount of the granulated ash fertilizer was bigger, the amount of environmental burden it produced was much lower. Therefore, the production of the potential symbiosis product could have benefits in terms of \{GWP\} results and overall environmental performance when compared to use of primary raw materials.},

	abstract = {The most commonly cited definition of industrial symbiosis (IS), by Chertow (2000), has served well to foster discussion and research for more than a decade. The definition reflected the state of research and practice at the time; as both have advanced, some terms have been interpreted in substantially different ways. In this article we analyze those generally used terms for their connection to the ecological metaphor that is the root of industrial ecology, and their varied interpretations in IS research and practice over time. We then propose an updated definition intended to communicate the essence of IS as a tool for innovative green growth: IS engages diverse organizations in a network to foster eco-innovation and long-term culture change. Creating and sharing knowledge through the network yields mutually profitable transactions for novel sourcing of required inputs and value-added destinations for non-product outputs, as well as improved business and technical processes. We posit that, although geographic proximity is often associated with IS, it is neither necessary nor sufficient—nor is a singular focus on physical resource exchange.},

This study aims to quantitatively examine the effects of IS performance on carbon emission reduction through a case study on Xinfa Group, a comprehensive large enterprise group in China. A scenario without IS is assumed for comparison. Results show that the carbon emission rates with and without IS are 16.20 Mt of CO2e and 18.17 Mt of CO2e, respectively. The largest carbon emission sector is the electrolytic aluminum industry, which accounts for 70.2\% of the total. The carbon emissions under the IS condition at Xinfa Group decrease by 10.84\% compared with that under the no IS condition. The carbon emission reduction primarily results from byproduct exchange and energy symbiosis, with rates of 72\% and 28\%, respectively. Carbon emission reduction as a result of energy-graded utilization is 11.4\%. Carbon emission reduction from calcined lime, alumina, calcium carbide, and other industries accounts for 60.7\%, 18.7\%, 0.9\%, and 27.1\% of the total emission reduction, respectively. The characteristics of IS development at the Xinfa Group are presented.},

Most EIPs are at a very early stage of development, where linkages are potential rather than real. The problems encountered in developing EIPs from scratch suggests that a more fruitful approach is to build upon existing and potential linkages within a locality, assisted by a pro-active policy to encourage interchanges.},

The famous ‘industrial symbiosis’ that formed in and around the Danish city of Kalundborg and other similar cases in other parts of Europe and North America are taken as a point of departure. These recycling linkages were found to be primarily the result of the entrepreneurial actions that aimed to create value out of by-products and/or to reduce production costs through the adoption of new inputs. As the incentives driving this behaviour are not new, this paper contends that ‘industrial symbiosis’ is not, as is usually believed, a break with past practices, but rather a widespread phenomenon that has been neglected by contemporary researchers. Historical evidence is provided to support this claim. It is argued that while significant inter-firm recycling linkages will spontaneously emerge at the regional level, these should not be forced at the expense of inter-regional linkages.},

This paper discusses a voluntary certification scheme adopted by the regional government of Tuscany (Italy) as a policy tool to disseminate the concepts of industrial ecology. The approval of a regional regulation represents the first adoption in European environmental and industrial policies of a voluntary tool aimed at stimulating the creation and dissemination of eco-industrial parks. This new certification method is analysed by focusing on the prevention of pollution. The criteria required to obtain the qualification, and the roles and responsibilities of all the actors involved are outlined. Finally, the strengths and weaknesses of the certification scheme are highlighted and the Italian standard compared with the national standard issued in China by the State Environmental Protection Administration. The findings contribute to the discussion of policy measures aimed at disseminating the concepts of Industrial Ecology including a tool based on voluntary co-operation and third-party certifications.},

	abstract = {Abstract Distributed energy systems are key in building a sustainable energy economy. Biofuels are an example of an industry that needs to be based on a system of rather small-scale local production units due to the limited transportation radius of biomass. Moreover, the benefits of biofuels are greater if their production is based on the integration of local production activities and consumption among traditionally separate industries, as implied by the notion of industrial symbiosis. Such an arrangement, however, requires the establishment of industrial ecosystems that are customised to local conditions, which increases costs and uncertainty for the involved stakeholders and the integrating company. In this paper, we discuss replication strategy as a means of transferring not only technical knowledge, but also the business format to new locations, thereby achieving ‘economies of repetition'. The case of a biogas-for traffic solution serves as an illustrative example. We analyse the establishment of a ‘vanguard' ecosystem and assess the potential of replicating the solution in six other locations. Based on this, we propose a replication framework that builds on functional modularisation, collaboration mechanisms required for cooperating with the relevant stakeholders, and organisational learning. The replication approach is expected to be useful for the companies attempting to build sustainable distributed energy systems based on industrial symbiosis.},

Four typical development strategies were simulated during 2005–2020 via standard system dynamic models. Furthermore, analytic hierarchy process and grey cluster allowed for the eco-industrial system evaluation and scenarios optimizing. Our dynamic simulation and statistical analysis revealed that: (1) CCETDZ would have different development scenarios under different strategies. The total population in scenario 2 grew most rapidly and reached 3.28 × 105 in 2020, exceeding its long-term planning expected population. And the GDP differences among these four scenarios would amount to 6.41 × 1010 RMB. On the other hand, environmental pollution would become serious along with economy increasing. As a restriction factor, positive or negative increment of water resource will occur according to the selected strategy. (2) The fourth strategy would have the best efficiency, which means that the most efficiently development of CCETDZ required to take science, technology, environment progress and economy increase into account at the same time. (3) Positive environment protection measures, such as cleaner production, green manufacture, production life cycle management and environment friendly industries, should be attached great importance the same as economy development during 2005–2020 in CCETDZ.},

	abstract = {Abstract Industrial port cities are essential components in a society dependant on fossil fuels and low cost energy. In the global move towards a low-carbon society, industrial port cities are emblematic of complex and integrated socio-ecological systems, which are experiencing transition processes related to interactions between bio-geo-physical components and governance. Using a socio-ecological system framework, this article provides insights into innovative regional eco-industrial development strategies for moving toward a low-carbon future in industrial port areas. Based on three case studies (Marseille-Fos in France, Ningbo in China, and Ulsan in South Korea), our analysis focuses on the changing relationships between energy, land cover, time use, and governance. The historical socio-ecological transition of industrial port cities is described as a stepwise process of spatial and functional disconnection/connection of port industrial complexes, which decouple/combine the port city's metabolism from local resources. We highlight the impacts of globalization on port-city socio-ecological trends, describing the effects of the integration of port cities into global economic processes, the impact of global awareness on global environmental changes, and the accelerating pace of change. We compare low-carbon strategies, revealing similarities in terms of conversion toward low carbon sources and growing connectedness and functional diversity of port-industrial systems.},

	abstract = {Abstract Bioethanol has been considered as an important type of renewable energy that can help reduce energy crisis and environmental degradation. Under economic, technology, and sustainability consideration, food based 1st generation bioethanol and lignocellulosic-based 2nd generation bioethanol have to exist simultaneously. Therefore, it is necessary to design a hybrid generation bioethanol supply chain (HGBSC) to sustainably meet the ever-increasing energy demand and different government-mandated sustainability standards related to green sustainability such as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, irrigation land and water usage, and energy efficiency. This paper is the first to examine different type of bioethanol plant configurations including industrial symbiosis strategy in order to meet high sustainability standards and design robust and sustainable industrial symbiosis based hybrid generation bioethanol supply chains (ISHGBSC). A novel stochastic mixed integer linear programming (SMILP) model is proposed to design the optimal ISHGBSC under different sustainability standards. A case study of North Dakota (ND) in USA has been studied as an application of the proposed model. The results show that some sustainability standards are stronger than others in terms of the number of green sustainability requirements met. When stronger sustainability standards are applied, the economic performance of the ISHGBSC is sacrificed. The results provide a guideline for policymakers to determine the appropriate standard to use under different sustainable concerns, and for policymakers and investors the best ISHGSBC structure under each standard. In addition, the results provide investors a guideline to invest in different technologies under different sustainability standards. Sensitivity analyses is also conducted to provide deep understanding of the proposed ISHGBSC and to identify the factors that might impact the stability of the ISHGBSC under different standards.},

	abstract = {Industrial ecology (IE) is a scientific field related to the exchanges between the natural and industrial ecosystem with the aim of creating a more sustainable society. A way to use the concept of IE in practice is the concept of Industrial symbiosis (IS), which is a method to create an industrial ecosystem similar to the natural one. The aim of this master thesis work was to analyze various approaches to initiating industrial symbiosis within the context of Sweden. One approach took a national scope where the goal was to identify different regions suitable for industrial symbiosis; meanwhile a second approach was on a regional or local level where the different energy and material flows between companies in a region were analyzed. The overall purpose of the project was to increase the resource (material, energy and other) cycling within Swedish regions. The two approaches are quite different and was therefore divided into two separate projects, presented separately in this paper and then followed by a general discussion and conclusion about the whole work and IS in general. The first project consisted of connecting industrial processes with LCI data and waste statistics in order to uncover different energy and material flows between companies located in Sweden. Meanwhile the second project was based on a more traditional way of collecting data, where a large amount of companies where invited to a synergy discovering workshop. The methodology used in the first project worked well where regions with high potentials for industrial material recycling such as Helsingborg were identified. However, the method is strongly dependent on the allocation of LCI process data, and poor information can lead to overly aggregated material flow information. During the work with the second (networking) project it became clear that companies were interested in energy and material flows, but they had not thought about the optimization of such as IS earlier. The utilization of workshops was regarded as a good method for gathering a large amount of information efficiently. However, the energy required coordinating and the difficulty in gaining a broad attendance to such events is a large drawback. Industrial symbiosis is a working concept in United Kingdom (UK), of which National Industrial Symbiosis Programme is a good example of, but it could be difficult to implement the same working methods in Sweden due to the different driving forces regarding waste. For example, various regulative measures and market prices that brings Sweden to landfill much less than the UK at this point. In the local workshop, it was realized that the municipality of Sigtuna was not a prone region for performing specific cost benefit analysis (CBA) or material flow accounting (MFA) regarding the possibilities for IS.},

The program has just passed its ten-year anniversary. This study aims to assess the economic and environmental performance of the 17 accredited sector-integrated national demonstration eco-industrial parks. A selected group of ten metrics, including resource consumption, economic development, and waste emissions, are applied to assess the performance by comparing the difference of metrics between reference years of eco-industrial park planning and accreditation. The main findings include: (1) industrial added value of the 17 eco-industrial parks as a whole increased by 56\%; (2) for comprehensive energy consumption, fresh water consumption, industrial wastewater generation, and solid waste production, the 17 eco-industrial parks had an overall increase of 20\%, 18\%, 12\%, and 6\%, respectively. The quantity of energy and fresh water consumption, wastewater and solid waste generation in some eco-industrial parks started to decrease with economic growth. Meanwhile, the average intensity of the four metrics decreased by 22\%, 25\%, 28\%, and 32\%, respectively; (3) for chemical oxygen demand and sulfur dioxide, the eco-industrial parks accomplished a two-fold decrease in both total quantity of emissions and intensity. Chemical oxygen demand emissions and its intensity decreased by 25\% and 52\%, respectively. Sulfur dioxide emissions and its intensity decreased by 51\% and 69\%m respectively. Measures supporting the performance improvement of Chinese national demonstration eco-industrial parks are also discussed, which mainly include cleaner production and environmental management, infrastructure sharing, energy-saving practices at the firm level, the pillar industries, and industrial symbiosis.},

We build upon basic sustainability principles known as The Natural Step (TNS) System Conditions by identifying and selecting quantifiable indicators for each of the conditions in the case of our target symbiosis. The study reveals that the environmental impacts of the case IS became more far-reaching during the 110-year period studied. Emissions, however, decreased substantially after the 1970s due to tightening environmental legislation and other policy measures and the progress in environmental technology, not due to symbiosis-type of arrangements. There has been no strong driver for more symbiosis-like cooperation among the companies in this study. It appeared that the main motives for increased collaboration were economic.},

	abstract = {Abstract As an important means of achieving sustainable development, eco-industrial parks have been given great significance at every level of Chinese governments, and as a result, they have made great strides in China. The increasing pressures of resource constraints and the need for environmental protection have made the achievement of optimal sustainable development performance crucial. Managers of eco-industrial park administrative committees, as decision makers and executors, have a pivotal role in the design, plan, and organization for the sustainable development of eco-industrial parks. Furthermore managers' environmental awareness is important when organizing environmental practices in their eco-industrial parks. This paper seeks to establish the value of the effects of managers' environmental awareness on the relationships between environmental practices and sustainable development performance by presenting an analysis of Chinese eco-industrial park projects. Using an empirical study, this paper first identifies the key environmental practices, directed by managers, which impact the sustainable development performance of Chinese eco-industrial parks. The moderating effect of managers' environmental awareness on the relationships between environmental practices and sustainable development performance is then developed. Our results show that instituting environmental norms for eco-industrial park enterprises, building industrial symbiosis, and providing guidance to key enterprises play significant roles in producing sustainable development performance for eco-industrial parks. Managers' environmental awareness is helpful in driving and transforming environmental practices into sustainable development performance. Our results also provide assistance for designing and implementing environmental practices for sustainable development, recruiting managers with higher environmental awareness, and training managers to improve their environmental awareness so that eco-industrial parks can achieve sustainable development performance.},

	abstract = {Eco-industrial parks (EIPs) provide a basis for applying the concept of industrial ecology. In Australia, eco-industrial parks are new and are being considered by state governments as a way of achieving more sustainable industrial development. However, for many firms, local government and communities, industrial ecology is a concept that is misunderstood and treated with suspicion. This paper uses research undertaken to investigate the application of industrial ecology to ensure more sustainable industry development in the State of Queensland, Australia, to develop a set of principles and planning guidelines for use by governments to facilitate the development of eco-industrial parks. Synergy Park, 22 km west of Brisbane, is Australia’s first planned eco-industrial park to be built. The planning and development of this eco-industrial park was a significant challenge to the developer and public agencies concerned with this project. The case study presented in this document provides useful lessons and advice for planners and developers involved with the planning and development of eco-industrial parks.},

	abstract = {Alcohol fuel is generally presented as a sustainable fuel in comparison with other fossil fuel due to lower emissions during production and combustion steps as well as due to its (assumed) closed carbon cycle. However, assessing the Brazilian traditional alcohol production cycle, many social and environmental impacts may still be indicated: burning, pesticides, biodiversity, labor exploration, high water consumption, erosion and others. Based on the strategy of an agro-industrial networking and symbiosis, a project was designed to optimize the system by means of polygeneration and total integration of production steps. The case presented in this paper is the project for a social and ecological agro-industry model, named GERIPA (Geração de Energia Renovável Integrada à Produção de Alimentos), which produces renewable fuel, electricity and organic food. Besides the technical project, an economic evaluation is also presented, resulting into a five year pay back time. In addition, environmental and social aspects were evaluated by means the Emergy Synthesis methodology (Odum, 1996), which assesses the value of all inputs through an estimate of the environmental work directly and indirectly required for their production and sustainable supply. The emergy-based comparison of GERIPA system and a traditional system in Brazil indicates better performance of GERIPA, with an eMergy Sustainability Index of 1.26, much higher than for a traditional system, 0.22. The project is presently under discussion with investors and Government and, if approved, will be carried out in marginal and presently unused land. In addition to providing an environmentally friendly process for food and energy production, the project would generate new jobs opportunities for Brazilian rural workers presently unemployed.},

Following this analogy, the conceptual model of an eco-industrial park, which is an organised form of the industrial ecosystem, was presented in this paper. The model comprises of (1) the structure of the ecosystem, (2) the classification of the enterprises as producers, consumers and decomposers, (3) mass and energy flows and (4) types of interactions. The classification of the enterprises introduced here as well as the analysis of mass and energy flows indicates that the diversity of the enterprises in eco-industrial parks is desired. Furthermore, the minimal condition to create the symbiotic relationships between the enterprises is established, claiming that at least one industrial producer or decomposer must be involved in the eco-industrial park. The application of this model will facilitate the design and development of eco-industrial parks and enable the identification of symbiotic relationships between the entities of such a park and other types of industrial ecosystems. In order to show the applicability of the proposed model and its potential for the practical implementation two case studies are presented.},

The evolution of an eco-industrial park is path-dependent acknowledging that both choices made in the past as well as the current context of the industrial sector are very important in determining its success. We study the industrial area of Venice, namely Porto Marghera, as a center of chemical industry activity in Italy, in order to understand two sets of factors that determine its destiny: the endogenous ones which emerge from local siting and decision making, and the exogenous ones, that are principally more regional and global in scope. The motivation in studying the Porto Marghera industrial park derives from its long and articulated history, its important economic role both at national and European levels, the complexity of the industries involved, the heavy environmental burden, and the high social conflict in the area. The aforementioned factors motivates our interest and indicates reasons for areas' eventual decline. We conclude that since 2004, had, either the endogenous factors or the exogenous ones – that influence the European or even global chemical industry, been favorable at the same time, there may have been an opportunity to stem the decline of the area. But without a strong basis the eco-industrial park faces a bleak future. We contribute to the literature a case study of the failure of a particular location to sustain its previously successful eco-industrial activity. Whether the fate of Porto Marghera should be seen as the natural outcome of a confluence of events over time, or as an outright failure, is discussed as a means of informing other industrial symbiosis projects.},

	abstract = {Abstract Industrial symbiosis (IS) has gained more attention in the production economics as the pressure on companies increases for the reduction of waste emissions and primary resources consumption. In fact, this has forced companies to provide other companies their wastes as primary resources and vice-versa. These supply circles lead to \{IS\} that can mitigate environmental impacts and costs in industrial areas (IA). The aim of this paper is to provide guidelines for the future evolution of \{IA\} operating on the basis of \{IS\} principles. Given a production network within an IA, perfect \{IS\} within the network is defined as a theoretical optimum for \{IS\} design where no primary resources is needed from outside and no wastes are discharged outside. Adopting an enterprise input–output approach, the conditions for a perfect \{IS\} are found for one-waste and multi-waste cases, and the distance between the states of the actual network and of the related perfect \{IS\} is measured. Proposed approach is empirically applied to Santa Croce sull'Arno industrial district of tannery where the recycling of chrome liquors, fleshing, and wastewater are investigated. Results show under which conditions perfect symbiosis is achievable for two waste types. Policy implications are also suggested for the design of \{IA\} when \{IS\} principles are adopted.},

	abstract = {Abstract Industrial symbiosis (IS) improves regional sustainability through inter-firm collaboration for more efficient use of materials and energy. Drawing on the literature of IS and complex networks, this paper proposes three forming processes of IS networks corresponding to different institutional settings – preferential growth under self-organization, homogeneous growth under coordination and facilitation, and random pairing under planning and policy promotion. We examine the growth of IS networks and the impact of promotional institutions by analyzing a diverse sample of 15 IS networks including 204 firms. Additional illustrations of by-product and utility networks are provided for the cases of Kalundborg (Denmark) and Kwinana (Australia). The results suggest that preferential growth is a dominant process widely held in self-organized IS networks, indicating an enduring disparity of firms' capabilities in building IS. Firm-organized coordination as well as government facilitation and promotion tend to change the preferential growth to a more homogeneous one, by improving the capabilities of previously disadvantaged firms. The improvement of disadvantaged firms and non-preferential growth under facilitation and promotion call for the overall symbiotic opportunities to be explored more thoroughly, and render the IS system more resilient in a region. This effect of policy promotion, however, may take time to change the IS system, and may be diminished in utility exchanges and in areas with fewer, undiversified firms, due to technical difficulties and lack of opportunities to expand an existing IS network. Policy-making and planning should take into consideration the local industry composition and context, as well as other cost associated with the policies to determine the appropriate extent of promotion and incentives.},

This concept and its application have also been the topic of extensive research. Up till now, this work lacks a more comprehensive theoretical framework, and this paper fills this gap. We provide a theoretical basis for understanding the dynamics through which regional industrial systems change their connectiveness in an attempt to reduce their ecological impact. We position our framework within the field of industrial symbiosis based on a comprehensive literature search in the \{ISI\} Web of Science database for publications that listed ‘industrial symbiosis', ‘eco-industrial park', or a combination of ‘industrial-ecology' and ‘regional' as a topic. The framework conceptualizes industrial symbiosis as a process at two levels: (1) the level of the regional industrial system (RIS), and (2) the societal level where the concept and routines of industrial symbiosis diffuse. We link the dynamics at these levels to changes in ecological impact and increase in institutional capacity. We conclude with a research agenda based on the variables and their basic relationships specified in our framework. The main line of research we propose is to systematically investigate how institutional capacity evolves over time in regional industrial systems and how it affects the ecological impact of such systems. We also propose to investigate how insights from existing literature about stimulating and impeding factors to industrial symbiosis can be understood in terms of mechanisms of transmission and how these mechanisms interact to create nationally distinct patterns of diffusion of industrial symbiosis.},

The approach is based on an analogy between certain objects studied by the science of ecology (ecosystems, metabolisms, symbiosis, biocenosis, etc.) and industrial systems.

Although there is agreement regarding its heuristic function, the analogy can nevertheless be understood either as a model or as a metaphor. The present article first attempts to show how models differ from metaphors. It then sets out to justify the epistemological relevance of this distinction for industrial ecology research. The reflection should thus contribute to clarifying the debate on the (supposed or desired) role of analogy in the field of industrial ecology and heighten the interest this field of investigation represents for implementing sustainable development.},

A partir de datos empíricos recogidos a partir de los métodos de etnografía y teoría fundamentada, un análisis sistemático de la conducta defensora dejó patente como tema emergente que los defensores de los parques ecoindustriales hacen hincapié en la importancia de las relaciones sociales y no en las conexiones tecnológicas. Predominaron los temas frecuentes de confianza y arraigamiento en la comunidad, proximidad y la importancia de los defensores para obtener una viabilidad del proyecto a largo plazo. La base del éxito de los defensores fue su capacidad de establecer conexiones humanísticas para avanzar en el proyecto de la ecología industrial.

	abstract = {Abstract The location of agricultural activities in favourable geographic areas has led to the development of local agglomerations of companies, recognised as agri-food clusters (AFCs). AFCs are characterised by typical environmental problems such as changes in land use, CO2 emissions, energy and water consumption, and chemical pollution. Recent technological changes in the agri-food industry have influenced the economic and social development of AFCs towards progressive industrialization. Such changes have also been the source of new environmental problems, such as those related to the large-scale use and disposal of auxiliary materials. Industrial Ecology (IE) proposes approaches and applied solutions to reduce the environmental impacts and improve the competitiveness of production activities. Major applications of IE in AFCs currently involve the valorisation of animal and vegetable by-products and scraps. Further improvements can be achieved by adopting IE-based solutions focused on auxiliary material wastes. This article analyses the potential development of IE-based approaches in a representative Italian AFC. Empirical evidence shows that efficient solutions can be implemented through material substitution, repair, and recycling, and by exploiting collaborative strategies among the agri-food and industrial companies established in the area.},

The goal of the paper is to analyze in depth the process of exergy cost formation of flows within a system, which change when it is integrated with other systems, by using two complimentary approaches. First, a strategy based on irreversibility of the different components and effects of waste internalization already developed is applied for the first time to an example of Industrial Symbiosis. Second, a new method tracing the origin of the different resources consumed by the system is developed. This approach is very interesting for Industrial Symbiosis examples, characterized by a diversity of resources. A system composed of a coal-fired power plant, a cement kiln and a gas-fired boiler operating in isolated and integrated fashion is analyzed by using both presented approaches.},

	abstract = {The UK National Industrial Symbiosis Programme (NISP), the first national industrial symbiosis (IS) programme, is 'sustainability in action', accruing environmental, economic and social benefits. NISP brings together companies and organisations of all sectors and sizes, generating significant environmental benefits such as reduced greenhouse gases and landfill diversion, as well as cost reductions and new sales. This in turn encourages economic activity, which generates further social benefits with the creation of new businesses and jobs, and stimulates process improvements for industry through innovation and new technologies. For the NISP practitioner, quantification of IS benefits is vital to substantiate the business case necessary to secure engagement with industry, and to secure credibility and hence funding from government, underscoring the importance of metrics and measurement in industrial symbiosis programmes. The external audit system was put in place to demonstrate value for money from a novel business-opportunity approach to accomplishing the goals, both economic and environmental, of the programme's funders. However the benefits of measurement have gone well beyond this initial need to helping the programme directors understand the needs of the participating companies, and areas for improvement in the programme's operations.},

	abstract = {Abstract This paper explores geospatial industrial diversity and its influence on the brokerage of industrial symbiosis working agreements (otherwise known as synergies). Research conducted in 2011 concluded that within third-party brokered resource exchanges between two or more normally unrelated companies, the industrial diversity of a given geographic area was the primary driver behind how far a material travels from its point of origin to its point of reuse. This conclusion was largely derived from intuition and the elimination of other widely discussed drivers or limitations to symbiotic resource movement (e.g., mental distances, resource value and/or the physical characteristics of a resource). The presented article sets out to empirically test this suggestion by mapping the geospatial industrial diversity of England and comparing it to the movement of resources within synergies facilitated by the National Industrial Symbiosis Programme (NISP). Among other results, it was established that there are correlations between geospatial industrial diversity and the distance materials move in addition to the number of synergy types and the replication of synergies facilitated within a given area. It was found that 76\% of synergies were facilitated within areas of high (upper 10\% of values) contiguous diversity, areas of high ‘species' richness possessed a greater variety of synergies, and areas of high synergy replication were areas of high ‘species' population evenness. Based on a sensitivity analysis of diversity indices and diversity mapping techniques, it was concluded that high ‘species' richness provided the greatest opportunities for realising local industrial symbiosis.},

However, for several reasons the effects of governmental policy actions on industrial symbiosis are still not clear. This article proposes a research agenda to clarify the mechanisms of policy intervention and facilitation of industrial symbiosis based on a comprehensive review of industrial symbiosis literature, focusing on how policy is conceptualized and studied. The results show that existing research lacks an explicit definition of policy, and employs a static conceptualization of policy that is reinforced by comparative statics research methods. We argue that a dynamic process perspective is crucial to reveal the actual mechanisms through which policy intervention and facilitation affect the evolution of industrial symbiosis. Building on this view, industrial symbiosis research is connected with insights from policy sciences, and the case of policy translation of Circular Economy and Eco-industrial Park in China is investigated in order to illustrate that policy is at heart a dynamic process. We conclude with a research agenda proposing that the key to reveal the mechanisms is to identify the sequence of events connecting policy process and industrial symbiosis practices.},

	abstract = {Abstract This paper explores various forms of eco-industrial networks in advancing environmental sustainability. Prior research on environmental sustainability primarily identifies industrial actors as autonomous entities or considers the role of networks in advancing environmental sustainability from a rather narrow perspective. However, the networks of ties in which industrial firms are embedded profoundly impacts not only their own performance, but also the natural environment in which they operate. Based on a systematic literature review, we identify four forms of eco-industrial networks that have the potential to advance environmental sustainability: 1) symbiosis networks, 2) sustainable supply networks, 3) environmental issue networks and 4) environmental solution networks. The paper presents important insights on the operational logic for each of these network forms and the dimensions of their network architecture. The main implications of this comparison are that policy-makers and practitioners need to become aware of the various mechanisms through which inter-organisational networks can reduce environmental load. Furthermore, there is a need to build broad coalitions of organisations that are mobilised to address environmental issues. We suggest that network architecture which maximises its members' capability to self-organise while also including a coordinating organisation can be highly suitable for eco-industrial networks. We also suggest some fruitful avenues for future research on eco-industrial networks. In integrating research on eco-industrial networks with existing research on inter-organisational alliances and networks, the paper provides more understanding on the multifaceted role played by various forms of eco-industrial networks in advancing sustainability.},

	abstract = {It is widely acknowledged that China's economic miracle has been achieved at the expense of its natural capital and environment. In order to deal with this problem, the circular economy (CE) has been chosen as a national policy for sustainable development. National laws and regulations have been enacted to facilitate the implementation of CE and national CE demonstration projects have been initiated such that national benchmarking activities could be completed. China is the first country to release nationally focused CE indicators so that objective and credible information on the status of CE implementation can be recognized. These CE indicators are valuable metrics for policy and decision-makers and can help achieve CE goals and outcomes. This unique indicator system has not been communicated to international communities. This paper aims to more broadly introduce this unique national CE indicator system. China's CE efforts are first detailed with various provisions of the national indicator system. A critical analysis of such an indicator system is presented. We show that certain benefits can be gained, but substantive revision is also needed due to the lack of a comprehensive set of sustainability indicators which should include social, business indicators, urban/industrial symbiosis, absolute material/energy reduction, and prevention-oriented indicators. Concerns related to barriers on implementation are also presented in this paper. The knowledge gained from Chinese efforts on CE indicators are valuable to both developed and developing nations seeking to implement sustainable development measures within their regulatory policies.},

Different from the traditional development mode which merely relocating industries outside of the cities for pursuing sustainable development, eco-industrial development makes significant innovation by treating or utilizing wastes (i.e. solid wastes and waste energy) in a smart way for local industries to achieve a win–win situation. In order to investigate the eco-benefits of eco-industrial development in China, this study focused on an industrial and urban symbiosis case of Guiyang city in which process synergy, municipal solid wastes recycling and waste energy utilization were incorporated in this typical industrial city. This city is resource-dependent, has many heavy industries, and these severely hinder sustainable development in this city. In order to promote eco-industrial development, an integrated coal, electricity, aluminum, phosphor chemical, iron/steel industry and urban symbiosis network was firstly designed, with linkages between various industries through energy exchanges and process synergies. Subsequently, a quantitative assessment on the life cycle environmental benefits were further conducted. Then, we found that a dramatic resource saving and carbon dioxide emission reduction can be achieved. Finally, some policy implications to address the barriers of promoting industrial and urban symbiosis were proposed. This study is critical for future industrial and urban planning policy making and shed a light on innovative eco-industrial development in China.},

This article provides a historical view of the motivations and means for pursuing industrial symbiosis—defined to include physical exchanges of materials, energy, water, and by-products among diversified clusters of firms. It finds that “uncovering” existing symbioses has led to more sustainable industrial development than attempts to design and build eco-industrial parks incorporating physical exchanges. By examining 15 proposed projects brought to national and international attention by the U.S. President's Council on Sustainable Development beginning in the early 1990s, and contrasting these with another 12 projects observed to share more elements of self-organization, recommendations are offered to stimulate the identification and uncovering of already existing “kernels” of symbiosis. In addition, policies and practices are suggested to identify early-stage precursors of potentially larger symbioses that can be nurtured and developed further. The article concludes that environmentally and economically desirable symbiotic exchanges are all around us and now we must shift our gaze to find and foster them.},

Industrial symbiosis (IS) provides a system innovation to utilize the industry to fight climate change and pursue sustainable urban development, while few attentions are paid in literatures. Under this circumstance, this study reviews the low-carbon city practice in China and conducts a case study to calculate the CO2 emissions reduction potential under promoting IS projects in two cities of China, named Jinan and Liuzhou. With the real national project in Jinan as advanced example, new scenarios related to IS are designed for Liuzhou, including comprehensive energy network, waste plastics recycling, scrap tires recycling and flying ash recycling. The material/waste and energy exchange is quantified in the IS network, as well as the related environmental benefit. The material/energy exchange is over 10 million ton and 20 thousands tce in Jinan's case, and 2.5 million ton and 45 thousand tce in Liuzhou's case. Results highlight that IS could effectively reduce CO2 emissions. The total reduction potential amounts to 3944.05 thousands tCO2/year and 2347.88 thousands tCO2/year in Jinan and Liuzhou. Finally, policy implications on the ever-improvement of industrial symbiosis and China's sustainable urban development are proposed and discussed.},

	abstract = {Abstract Industrial symbiotic networks are based on the principles of ecological systems where waste equals food, to develop synergistic networks. For example, industrial symbiosis (IS) at Kalundborg, Denmark, creates an exchange network of waste, water, and energy among companies based on contractual dependency. Since most of the industrial symbiotic networks are based on ad-hoc opportunities rather than strategic planning, gaining insight into disruptive scenarios is pivotal for understanding the balance of resilience and sustainability and developing heuristics for designing resilient \{IS\} networks. The present work focuses on understanding resilience as an emergent property of an \{IS\} network via a network-based approach with application to the Kalundborg Industrial Symbiosis (KIS). Results from network metrics and simulated disruptive scenarios reveal Asnaes power plant as the most critical node in the system. We also observe a decrease in the vulnerability of nodes and reduction in single points of failure in the system, suggesting an increase in the overall resilience of the \{KIS\} system from 1960 to 2010. Based on our findings, we recommend design strategies, such as increasing diversity, redundancy, and multi-functionality to ensure flexibility and plasticity, to develop resilient and sustainable industrial symbiotic networks.},

We elucidate its embedding in industrial ecology (IE), trace the development of research themes, and reveal the evolution of the research network through analysis of the core literature and journals that appeared from 1997 to 2012 by citation analysis, cocitation analysis, and network analysis.In the first period (1997–2005), IS research held a minority share in the IE literature. The research revolved around the concept of IS, the assessment of eco-industrial park projects, and the establishment of waste treatment and recycling networks. In the second period (2006–2012), diverse research approaches and theories enriched the field, which has led to a maturation in theory building. Our findings clearly illustrate that IS evolved from practice-oriented research toward coherent theory building through a systematic underpinning and linking of diverse topics. As scientific attention shifted from exploring a phenomenon to elucidating underlying mechanisms, IS knowledge found worldwide practical implementation. The coauthorship network shows that the academic communities of IS are distributed worldwide and that international collaboration is widespread.Through bibliometric and network analysis of IS, we have created a systemic, quantitative image of the evolution of the IS research field and community, which gives IS researchers an underpinned overview of the IS research and may help them to identify new directions and synergy in worldwide research.},

Firms that engage in IS are said to belong to an industrial ecosystem. Symbiosis has been found to be motivated by economic considerations, such as lowering costs for waste disposal, as well as by environmental ones, such as accessing limited water supplies. Communication and trust among managers are thought to play important roles in exchanges; however, empirical studies have not been previously conducted. This study used social network analysis (SNA) to identify the prevalence of industrial symbiosis linkages in Barceloneta, Puerto Rico. The study quantified patterns in various relationships among firms and managers, including formal relations through supply chains, and informal ones through interpersonal interactions. SNA and statistical methods were used to explore how these ties correlate with observed industrial symbiosis activities. IS linkages were found to be less prevalent than product sales among firms and were concentrated among pharmaceutical firms at the core of the regional network. Trust among managers and position in the social hierarchy were found to be correlated with IS but not supply chain links. SNA was useful for examining the organization of different relationships in the industrial ecosystem, but contextual information is still needed to add meaning to its findings.},

Using this method, both energy and material flows on both the supply and the demand side can be studied simultaneously. The method can be used to find improvements in the structure of the modelled system, to find the optimal operational strategy of a given system, and to evaluate and compare different systems. The total system costs for stand-alone cases and integrated industrial symbiosis system configuration are compared, generating results that can be used as decision support when planning industrial symbiosis initiatives in the forest industry. The results of this study showed that there are financial benefits to industrial symbiosis compared to the same system operated in stand-alone mode, and that the industrial symbiosis configuration generates a more stable system. However, it is difficult to generalize the results from a case study, and the main conclusion drawn is that it is possible to show that industrial symbiosis has economical benefits, although the magnitude of these benefits needs to be evaluated from case to case.},

	abstract = {Industrial symbiosis (IS) emerged as a self-organizing business strategy among firms that are willing to cooperate to improve their economic and environmental performance. The adoption of such cooperative strategies relates to increasing costs of waste management, most of which are driven by policy and legislative requirements. Development of IS depends on an enabling context of social, informational, technological, economical and political factors. The power to influence this context varies among the agents involved such as the government, businesses or coordinating entities. Governmental intervention, as manifested through policies, could influence a wider range of factors; and we believe this is an area which is under-researched. This paper aims to critically appraise the waste policy interventions from supra-national to sub-national levels of government. A case study methodology has been applied to four European countries i.e. Denmark, the UK, Portugal and Switzerland, in which IS emerged or is being fostered. The findings suggest that there are commonalities in policy instruments that may have led to an IS enabling context.

This paper provides an approach to quantify the environmental performance of industrial symbiosis networks using guidance from the literature of life cycle assessment. Additionally, an approach to distribute credits due to exchanges for firms in the industrial symbiosis network is outlined. From the approach, influential methodological considerations used for the quantifications are discussed, including e.g. the production of reference systems, allocation methods, system boundaries and functional unit. The implications of such an approach may be beneficial for the industrial symbiosis community and provide information crucial for taxes, subsidies, business relations, expansion possibilities for the network, marketing and other issues related to the environmental performance of firms in the industrial symbiosis network.},
