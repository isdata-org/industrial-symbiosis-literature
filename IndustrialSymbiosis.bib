	abstract = {Developing countries like India, characterized by large working populations and significantly lower cost of capital, have become hotbeds for manufacturing activities. A distinctive feature in regions of India is that majority of the industrial materi al flows are through unorganized micro, small and medium scale enterprises (MSMEs). These highly constrained MSMEs have limited resources to comply with environmental regulations because of significant investments required in pollution control measures. An important way to improve the environmental performance of these industrial clusters is to quantify, treat, and reduce industrial byproducts. This objective could be achieved through industrial symbiosis or byproduct synergy, terms used for beneficial reuse of materials or energy streams from one facility by another. In the present study an attempt has been made to identify and understand existing and potential industrial symbiosis connections in Muzaffarnagar, an industrial town in north India home to several dozen paper mills, another dozen sugar mills, and a large range of other MSME manufacturing entities. In addition to the presence of small and medium enterprises there is also a strong bond between industry owners in the region.},

As eco-industrial developments have resulted in varying levels of success it is necessary for new EID programmes to understand the lessons from both the successful and less successful earlier cases. This study has been undertaken to compare the implication of the National Industrial symbiosis Programme (NISP) in the UK, regarded as an active EID case, with the Korean eco-industrial park scheme as a newly implemented one. The two EID models were analysed with a framework centred on three practical aspects: the underlying approach to EID, the organisational framework and the operational framework. Comparing the two models based on the three aspects, this study suggests several implications for the implementation of EID in Korea, including business centred approach, expanding EIPs to regional EID, standardising operational framework and developing innovative synergy generation tools.},

	abstract = {The UK National Industrial Symbiosis Programme (NISP), the first national industrial symbiosis (IS) programme, is 'sustainability in action', accruing environmental, economic and social benefits. NISP brings together companies and organisations of all sectors and sizes, generating significant environmental benefits such as reduced greenhouse gases and landfill diversion, as well as cost reductions and new sales. This in turn encourages economic activity, which generates further social benefits with the creation of new businesses and jobs, and stimulates process improvements for industry through innovation and new technologies. For the NISP practitioner, quantification of IS benefits is vital to substantiate the business case necessary to secure engagement with industry, and to secure credibility and hence funding from government, underscoring the importance of metrics and measurement in industrial symbiosis programmes. The external audit system was put in place to demonstrate value for money from a novel business-opportunity approach to accomplishing the goals, both economic and environmental, of the programme's funders. However the benefits of measurement have gone well beyond this initial need to helping the programme directors understand the needs of the participating companies, and areas for improvement in the programme's operations.},

This paper discusses the notion of entropy and the relationship of entropy to environmental management of industrial activities. In the paper, two case studies of Eco-Industrial Networks are presented: the case of aluminium and that of copper. The analysis of case studies made clear, firstly, that the production of aluminium or copper by recycling new scrap generates significantly less specific entropy than the production of the same product from primary raw materials and, secondly, that the effort of closing the loops of material flows aiming at complete recycling leads to higher generation of specific entropy than those which correspond to the use of primary raw materials. It is proven that there exists an entropy limit of environmental effectiveness when recycling each product. The present paper comments on this limit.},

Following a generic review of technical, political, economic, informational, and organisational factors that can have major influences on the development and functioning of IS networks and the role of coordination bodies aiming to catalyse the system developments, major political and institutional elements relevant to IS developments and applicable to all three regions are outlined. Experiences from individual IS programmes are then shared and analysed in light of technical, informational and organisational factors and the attributes of coordination bodies. Such analyses indicate the dominating importance of the organizational factors such as the history of industrial development, intensity of social interactions among relevant parties, and their mental proximity. Experiences also reveal that the perception of regional parties about the coordinating bodies is influential on the effectiveness of development efforts. A set of recommendations drawn from the analysis is intended to inform further similar efforts under National Industrial Symbiosis Programme (NISP). The paper concludes by highlighting the need of aligning the functioning of emerging networks with the requirements of longer term sustainability, which imposes higher challenges on coordination bodies.},

	abstract = {Many anthropogenically-produced or beneficiated materials contained in “end-of-life” products retain a great proportion of the invested manufacturing work when discarded. Very few such materials are reconstituted and applied in new products at the same material inherent quality level as in their first lifetime – a process known as “closed-loop recycling”. In general, industrial society maintains an extract, expend, expel modus operandi despite demonstrated “loop closure” feasibility for a significant number of materials. This thesis builds from a foundation in Industrial Ecology, a field prescribing to an ecological metaphor for how paradigmatic change might take place towards closure of material-energy cycles. It utilises three detailed case studies of loop closure work to develop a conceptual framework describing behaviour of industrial actors when faced with the opportunity, or need, to innovate for material cycle closure. This work helps answer questions about why work towards closure for “promising” material cycles may not be progressing, where key barriers lie, and how measures might be implemented to encourage the evolution of industrial conduct towards more widespread closed-loop recycling.},

	title = {Strategic approaches for initiating {Industrial} {Symbiosis} – {A} {Swedish} application of two methods for mapping new symbiosis opportunities},
	abstract = {Industrial ecology (IE) is a scientific field related to the exchanges between the natural and industrial ecosystem with the aim of creating a more sustainable society. A way to use the concept of IE in practice is the concept of Industrial symbiosis (IS), which is a method to create an industrial ecosystem similar to the natural one. The aim of this master thesis work was to analyze various approaches to initiating industrial symbiosis within the context of Sweden. One approach took a national scope where the goal was to identify different regions suitable for industrial symbiosis; meanwhile a second approach was on a regional or local level where the different energy and material flows between companies in a region were analyzed. The overall purpose of the project was to increase the resource (material, energy and other) cycling within Swedish regions. The two approaches are quite different and was therefore divided into two separate projects, presented separately in this paper and then followed by a general discussion and conclusion about the whole work and IS in general. The first project consisted of connecting industrial processes with LCI data and waste statistics in order to uncover different energy and material flows between companies located in Sweden. Meanwhile the second project was based on a more traditional way of collecting data, where a large amount of companies where invited to a synergy discovering workshop. The methodology used in the first project worked well where regions with high potentials for industrial material recycling such as Helsingborg were identified. However, the method is strongly dependent on the allocation of LCI process data, and poor information can lead to overly aggregated material flow information. During the work with the second (networking) project it became clear that companies were interested in energy and material flows, but they had not thought about the optimization of such as IS earlier. The utilization of workshops was regarded as a good method for gathering a large amount of information efficiently. However, the energy required coordinating and the difficulty in gaining a broad attendance to such events is a large drawback. Industrial symbiosis is a working concept in United Kingdom (UK), of which National Industrial Symbiosis Programme is a good example of, but it could be difficult to implement the same working methods in Sweden due to the different driving forces regarding waste. For example, various regulative measures and market prices that brings Sweden to landfill much less than the UK at this point. In the local workshop, it was realized that the municipality of Sigtuna was not a prone region for performing specific cost benefit analysis (CBA) or material flow accounting (MFA) regarding the possibilities for IS.},

We elucidate its embedding in industrial ecology (IE), trace the development of research themes, and reveal the evolution of the research network through analysis of the core literature and journals that appeared from 1997 to 2012 by citation analysis, cocitation analysis, and network analysis.In the first period (1997–2005), IS research held a minority share in the IE literature. The research revolved around the concept of IS, the assessment of eco-industrial park projects, and the establishment of waste treatment and recycling networks. In the second period (2006–2012), diverse research approaches and theories enriched the field, which has led to a maturation in theory building. Our findings clearly illustrate that IS evolved from practice-oriented research toward coherent theory building through a systematic underpinning and linking of diverse topics. As scientific attention shifted from exploring a phenomenon to elucidating underlying mechanisms, IS knowledge found worldwide practical implementation. The coauthorship network shows that the academic communities of IS are distributed worldwide and that international collaboration is widespread.Through bibliometric and network analysis of IS, we have created a systemic, quantitative image of the evolution of the IS research field and community, which gives IS researchers an underpinned overview of the IS research and may help them to identify new directions and synergy in worldwide research.},

These methods were employed and tested in pragmatic combination through two of the author's case study projects. The first case study, performed between 2009 and 2012, employed a multi-stakeholder process aimed at improving the cycling of construction and demolition waste in the Stockholm region. The second case study produced a strategic tool (Looplocal) built for facilitating more efficient regional industrial resource networks. While the highly participative aim of the cases required a larger contribution of resources than that of more closed studies, it is arguable that the efficacy of approaching the project aims is improved through their employment.},

Firms that engage in IS are said to belong to an industrial ecosystem. Symbiosis has been found to be motivated by economic considerations, such as lowering costs for waste disposal, as well as by environmental ones, such as accessing limited water supplies. Communication and trust among managers are thought to play important roles in exchanges; however, empirical studies have not been previously conducted. This study used social network analysis (SNA) to identify the prevalence of industrial symbiosis linkages in Barceloneta, Puerto Rico. The study quantified patterns in various relationships among firms and managers, including formal relations through supply chains, and informal ones through interpersonal interactions. SNA and statistical methods were used to explore how these ties correlate with observed industrial symbiosis activities. IS linkages were found to be less prevalent than product sales among firms and were concentrated among pharmaceutical firms at the core of the regional network. Trust among managers and position in the social hierarchy were found to be correlated with IS but not supply chain links. SNA was useful for examining the organization of different relationships in the industrial ecosystem, but contextual information is still needed to add meaning to its findings.},

A bi-level fuzzy optimization model is developed to explore the effect of charging fees for the purchase of freshwater and the treatment of wastewater in optimizing the water exchange network of plants in an EIP. The effect of subsidizing exchange of streams between plants is also included in the model. Results show that it is not necessary to impose exorbitant fees, nor to completely subsidize costs associated with recycling, in order to induce significant reduction of the consumption of freshwater in the EIP.},

	abstract = {Industrial ecology is a label under which many linkages between production and consumption processes are grouped. This article is based on a social science approach, ranging from organisational learning to the analysis of industrial districts, in reflection to the techno-economic approach of the developments in the industrial ecology projects ‘INES 1994–1997 and INES Mainport 1999–2002’ in the Rotterdam harbour and industry complex. In relation to the growing attention for regional types of industrial ecology, the article aims to provide a useful social science analytical framework for investigating regional industrial ecology, and to develop a prescriptive approach that can stimulate such industrial ecology. Regional industrial ecological systems meet with static and dynamic issues as a result of specific system boundaries of their decision-making levels. The analytical framework provides insight into these issues through a focus on three phases of (regional) industrial ecology, the production of collective goods, and governance mechanisms. We find that the INES Mainport project is still in the first phase of industrial ecology. To go beyond this phase, the Rotterdam harbour and industry region faces the limits of system boundaries of the decision-making levels within the regional management.},

With an underlying argument of homology rather than analogy, the aim is to reconcile understanding, in physics, biology, ecology, and the industrial process. Hypotheses of homology are tested on the emergent patterns found in both natural and industrial systems—patterns in energy intensities, production and recycling, diversification, organisational life histories and selection pressures, and systemic stability. Preliminary support for the model is found in existing databases and in the literature. Some potential problems and model qualifications are highlighted. The model is then used to examine regional decline and sustainable industrial regeneration in the South Yorkshire region of the UK. Areas for further research, such as classification schemes, are identified.},

As such, the tool kit of complex systems science could enrich our understanding of how industrial ecosystems might evolve over time. In this article, I illustrate how an important tool of complex systems science—agent-based simulation—can help to identify those potential elements of an industrial ecosystem that could work together to achieve more eco-efficient outcomes. For example, I show how agent-based simulation can generate cost-efficient energy futures in which groups of firms behave more eco-efficiently by introducing strategically located clusters of renewable, low-emissions, distributed generation. I then explain how role-playing games and participatory modeling can build trust and reduce conflict about the sharing of common-pool resources such as water and energy among small clusters of evolving agents. Collective learning can encourage potential industrial partners to gradually cooperate by exchanging by-products and/or sharing common infrastructure by dint of their close proximity. This kind of coevolutionary learning, aided by participatory modeling, could help to bring about industrial symbiosis.},

Water is a key focus in the Kwinana industrial area, Western Australia's major heavy industrial region, where some 30 companies consume more than 35 000 mega litres per year of fresh water. Over the past decade, significant progress has been made towards the reduction of water consumption and improvements in effluent disposal in Kwinana. Another way to advance sustainable water use is through the realisation of regional synergies. These concern the capture, recovery and reuse of water and energy byproducts from other industries in close proximity. With up to 50 existing synergies already in place, Kwinana is recognised as a world leading example; however, more synergy opportunities appear to exist. Research is being undertaken to further develop synergies in Kwinana and also to deliver a targeted and customised toolkit. This article presents the research results, to date, including an overview of the Kwinana industrial area, and examples of existing water synergies showing their sustainability benefits and success factors.},

Past research illustrated that economic and environmental benefits appear self-evident, although detailed quantification has only been attempted of symbioses for energy and water utilities. This article provides a complimentary case study for Kawasaki, Japan. The 14 documented symbioses connect steel, cement, chemical, and paper firms and their spin-off recycling businesses. Seven key material exchanges divert annually at least 565 000 tons of waste from incineration or landfill. Four of these collectively present an estimated economic opportunity of 13.3 billion JPY (∼130 million USD) annually. Five symbioses involve utilization of byproduct and two sharing of utilities. The others are traditional or new recycling industries that do not specifically benefit from geographic proximity. The synergistic effect of urban and industrial symbiosis is unique. The legislative framework for a recycling-oriented society has contributed to realization of the symbioses, as has the availability of government subsidies through the Eco-Town program.},

In particular, the role of a municipality in developing regional industrial ecology, and, vice versa, the role of regional industrial ecology in developing MEM, will be reflected upon. It is argued that a municipality, serving as an institutional anchor tenant, may provide the regional IE effort with the needed institutional support. In return, regional IE seems to have the potential to provide a basis for increased co-operation between public and private actors of a region as well as integration of regional environmental and development issues.

Industrial symbiosis, a sub-field of industrial ecology, examines the flow of water, energy, materials, and by-products across firms in geographic proximity. Environmentally related co-location benefits often result that have not been a focus of traditional agglomeration economies, but extend the basic theory. This paper conceptualizes the relationship between agglomeration economies and industrial symbiosis, finding that many negative environmental externalities can be reduced while increasing production efficiency. Four industrial regions of Puerto Rico, all with agglomeration economies, but only two with significant industrial symbiosis, highlight the contribution of symbiosis and how it can influence both static and dynamic agglomeration economies.

Cet article conceptualise les relations entre les résultats de l'économie d'urbanisation et ceux de la symbiose industrielle selon lesquels de nombreux effets externes environnementaux négatifs peuvent être réduits tout en augmentant la productivité.

Industriesymbiose in Puerto Rico: umweltbezogene Agglomerationswirtschaften, Regional Studies. Im Bereich der Industriesymbiose – einem Untergebiet der Industrieökologie – werden die Ströme von Wasser, Energie, Materialien und Nebenprodukten zwischen Firmen innerhalb eines geografischen Bereichs untersucht. Ein häufiges Resultat sind umweltbezogene gemeinsame Standortvorteile, die bisher nicht im Mittelpunkt der traditionellen Agglomerationswirtschaften standen, sondern die Grundtheorie erweitern. In diesem Beitrag wird die Beziehung zwischen Agglomerationswirtschaften und Industriesymbiose konzeptualisiert, wobei festgestellt wird, dass sich zahlreiche negative Umweltexternalitäten bei gleichzeitiger Erhöhung der Produktionseffizienz reduzieren lassen. Anhand von vier Industrieregionen in Puerto Rico – alle mit Agglomerationswirtschaften, aber nur zwei mit signifikanter Industriesymbiose – wird der Beitrag der Symbiose hervorgehoben, und es wird verdeutlicht, wie sich die Symbiose auf statische und dynamische Agglomerationswirtschaften auswirken kann.

	abstract = {Resource sharing among co-located firmsreferenced in the industrial ecology literature as “industrial symbiosis”engages traditionally separate industries in a collective approach to business and environmental management involving the physical exchanges of materials, energy, water, and byproducts. While industrial symbiosis is seen hypothetically as a win-win situation, there are few analyses of the economic and environmental consequences for the individual participants in multi-faceted exchanges. In this article, the nascent industrial symbiosis network in Guayama, Puerto Rico, is explored from environmental, economic, and regulatory perspectives of the individual participants and the community. A coal-fired power plant, owned and operated by the AES Corporation, draws five million gallons per day of process water from nearby sources thus avoiding freshwater withdrawals and, through steam sales, significantly reduces emissions from a nearby refinery. This article quantifies economic and environmental costs and benefits for the symbiosis participants, concluding that there are substantial benefits to engaging in symbiosis, although these benefits fall unevenly on participating organizations. Policy intervention can be a viable means of motivating more regular occurrences of resource exchanges among groups of firms.},

	abstract = {Industrial symbiosis, as part of the emerging field of industrial ecology, demands resolute attention to the flow of materials and energy through local and regional economies. Industrial symbiosis engages traditionally separate industries in a collective approach to competitive advantage involving physical exchange of materials, energy, water, and/or by-products. The keys to industrial symbiosis are collaboration and the synergistic possibilities offered by geographic proximity. This paper reviews the small industrial symbiosis literature and some antecedents, as well as early efforts to develop eco-industrial parks as concrete realizations of the industrial symbiosis concept. Review of the projects is organized around a taxonomy of five different material exchange types. Input-output matching, stakeholder processes, and materials budgeting appear to be useful tools in advancing eco-industrial park development. Evolutionary approaches to industrial symbosis are found to be important in creating the level of cooperation needed for multi-party exchanges.},

This article provides a historical view of the motivations and means for pursuing industrial symbiosis—defined to include physical exchanges of materials, energy, water, and by-products among diversified clusters of firms. It finds that “uncovering” existing symbioses has led to more sustainable industrial development than attempts to design and build eco-industrial parks incorporating physical exchanges. By examining 15 proposed projects brought to national and international attention by the U.S. President's Council on Sustainable Development beginning in the early 1990s, and contrasting these with another 12 projects observed to share more elements of self-organization, recommendations are offered to stimulate the identification and uncovering of already existing “kernels” of symbiosis. In addition, policies and practices are suggested to identify early-stage precursors of potentially larger symbioses that can be nurtured and developed further. The article concludes that environmentally and economically desirable symbiotic exchanges are all around us and now we must shift our gaze to find and foster them.},

In addition to water conservation within individual plants, wastewater can be reused/recycled among different companies through inter-plant water integration (IPWI) schemes. Such schemes are based on the concept of industrial ecology and industrial symbiosis, and can be used to achieve greater water savings than when water conservation is implemented in individual companies separately. However, in IPWI, each participating company seeks to maximise its own benefits. In the absence of centralised authority dictating the terms of water integration schemes, conventional modelling techniques are not appropriate. This paper shows how a game theory-based approach can be used to analyse the interaction of participating companies in an eco-industrial park seeking to develop an IPWI scheme.},

The authors of this paper argue that unlike the usual way of applying industrial ecology as a technical tool or a practical instrument, ADCs need to adopt industrial ecology as a strategic vision and as a strategic approach to plan the economic, social and ecological development of their national economies. In this way, it can be possible for the ADCs to avoid the same problems that occurred when the developed countries experienced industrialization and rapid economic growth, and move toward more sustainable development.},

	abstract = {Industrial symbiosis (IS) emerged as a collective, multi-industrial approach to improve economic and environmental performance through the use of wastes/by-products as substitutes for raw materials. The development of IS initiatives depends on the context in which they occur, characterised in terms of social, economic, political, spatial and temporal embeddedness. As a consequence, the context can be influenced to become more supportive of IS through a continuous, interactive process, combining top-down governmental directives and bottom-up spontaneous business initiatives. A strategy to develop and enhance this process is explored in this paper and described by the authors as a middle-out approach.

Policies and policy instruments introduced by governmental agencies provide objectives and incentives to businesses. The middle-out approach induces the development of a strategy to create positive feedback loops among agents (e.g. government, industries) that may guide their actions into setting the conditions to support IS emergence.

This paper provides a case study that discusses a regional development of IS in Portugal that highlights critical factors for success in implementing IS, and shows that the middle-out approach can also be understood as an extension and combination of previous research on context factors and planned/spontaneous approaches to IS development.},

	abstract = {Industrial symbiosis (IS) emerged as a self-organizing business strategy among firms that are willing to cooperate to improve their economic and environmental performance. The adoption of such cooperative strategies relates to increasing costs of waste management, most of which are driven by policy and legislative requirements.

Development of IS depends on an enabling context of social, informational, technological, economical and political factors. The power to influence this context varies among the agents involved such as the government, businesses or coordinating entities. Governmental intervention, as manifested through policies, could influence a wider range of factors; and we believe this is an area which is under-researched.

This paper aims to critically appraise the waste policy interventions from supra-national to sub-national levels of government. A case study methodology has been applied to four European countries i.e. Denmark, the UK, Portugal and Switzerland, in which IS emerged or is being fostered.

The findings suggest that there are commonalities in policy instruments that may have led to an IS enabling context. The paper concludes with lessons learnt and recommendations on shaping the policy context for IS development.},

The famous ‘industrial symbiosis’ that formed in and around the Danish city of Kalundborg and other similar cases in other parts of Europe and North America are taken as a point of departure. These recycling linkages were found to be primarily the result of the entrepreneurial actions that aimed to create value out of by-products and/or to reduce production costs through the adoption of new inputs. As the incentives driving this behaviour are not new, this paper contends that ‘industrial symbiosis’ is not, as is usually believed, a break with past practices, but rather a widespread phenomenon that has been neglected by contemporary researchers. Historical evidence is provided to support this claim. It is argued that while significant inter-firm recycling linkages will spontaneously emerge at the regional level, these should not be forced at the expense of inter-regional linkages.},

This paper takes an historical approach to suggest that comprehensive planning is unlikely to live up to the expectations of its proponents.

The essay is structured as follows. The first section provides short case studies of industrial symbiosis in highly different economic and institutional settings, the essentially free-market regime of Victorian England and communist Hungary (1948–1989). The available evidence suggests that market coordination proved much more favorable to the emergence of industrial symbiosis, despite the elaboration of a comprehensive policy to that effect in Hungary. Insights derived from the so-called “Austrian” critique of central planning are then used to explain this paradox. The analysis presented suggests that the Hungarian planners’ failure was not so much the result of the bad implementation of sound policies, but the logical outcome of a top-down approach’s shortcomings. Policy implications for the public planning of industrial symbiosis in a mixed economy are then derived and the case for self-organization is found more compelling. The creation of more innovative institutions that will force firms to “internalize their externalities” while leaving them the necessary freedom to innovate is viewed as an urgently needed and promising path towards increased, sustainable reuse of industrial by-products.},

	abstract = {Local reuse of waste materials from industrial processes has many potential environmental benefits, but these have been difficult to aggregate and measure across industries on a broad geographic scale. Nonhazardous industrial waste is a high volume flow principally constituted of wastewater with some solid materials. The state of Pennsylvania produced some 20 million metric tons of these residual wastes in 2004. An innovative reporting requirement for industrial generators implemented and compiled by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection has resulted in a rich database collected since 1992 of residual waste generation, detailing the fate of more than 100 materials. By combining these records with life cycle inventory (LCI) data, the current and potential environmental benefits of residual waste use have been assessed. Results for Pennsylvania indicate a savings in 2004 of 13 PJ of primary energy, 0.9 million metric tons of CO2eq, 4300 tons of SO2eq, and 4200 tons of NOx emissions from reuse of residual wastes. While these energy savings constitute less than 1\% of total industrial primary energy use in the state, it is a greater quantity of energy than that generated by the state’s renewable energy sector. The framework and constraints surrounding reuse of residual waste in Pennsylvania are discussed.},

The development of industrial areas include several phases, one of them is the location decision that is one of the most important, since it will determine the park operation. For a long time, the location theories have only considered the proximity to raw materials, existence of basic infrastructures and qualified manpower. Nevertheless, the new model of sustainable development demands to realize a planning that defines and integrates the different subsystems and influential aspects. The aim of this work is to create a conceptual descriptive model to locate sustainable industrial areas. This model is based on long-established factors and new strategies and experiences of sustainability. The second step is the establishment of a diffuse evaluation system that determines the fulfilment of defined sustainable criteria. This model makes the planning process for the decision-makers easier through a system that considers multiple criteria that converge in order to get the balance of industrial activities with the environment.},

The particularly interesting feature of this case study is the use of a CEMS (in this case, ISO 14001) by the administrative group of the DETDZ to develop a more comprehensive approach to the wide range of environmental issues that they face in running the zone. In essence the goal is to address many of the issues at the level of the zone. The incentives, benefits, and barriers associated with implementing ISO 14001 are described. However, implementation of an EMS should not be thought of as the ultimate objective for an industrial park’s environmental management. The next steps include encouraging further public participation and taking an integrated approach leading to an industrial ecosystem, which can realize better environmental performance at the industrial park level.},

The increasing resource and environmental pressures have impeded RIACs' efforts to quickly promote their people's quality of life, while protecting their natural environment. Due to lack of resources, technologies and capital, RIACs need to seek a more integrated development strategy. Industrial ecology may be one solution, as it aims at optimizing the use of materials and energy in products, processes, industrial sectors and economies by systemically mimicking natural systems in an industrial setting. The relevant practices and experiences in the developed world have proved that there is a degree of effectiveness and efficiency to development through the application of industrial ecology. It is even more critical to applying the principles of industrial ecology in RIACs with fewer resources. However, compared with the developed nations, RIACs face different environmental, economic and social constraints. Therefore, RIACs have to adopt different approaches to implement the concept of industrial ecology. In this paper, we first introduce the environmental, economic and social constraints in RIACs and imply that RIACs need a sustainable industrial development strategy, namely, ‘producing more with less’. Then, we review the current practices on eco-industrial development in RIACs. As a specific case study, due to its size and increasing influence on the global economy and politics, China will be examined in detail with regard to its eco-industrial development practices. Through these approaches, the challenges to applying industrial ecology to RIACs will be analyzed and recommendations are provided.},

This model, formally accepted in 2002 and termed the 'circular economy', is understood to mean the realisation of a closed loop of material flows in the Chinese economic system. Successful implementation of this model is seen as one way in which China can 'leapfrog' past environmental damage that is typically seen as economies industrialise. This paper introduces the development of the model in China, and presents the current situation of circular economy practice in China. The paper describes current measures being implemented in China for the long-term promotion of a circular economy, including the formulation of objectives, legislation, policies and measures, so that the country can 'leapfrog' its way from environmentally-damaging development to a more sustainable path. The paper then identifies a series of barriers and challenges to the implementation of the concept in China. Finally, conclusions on the future of the circular economy concept are drawn. Data were derived primarily from an analysis of secondary sources (i.e. previously published papers). Additional primary data derived from the main author's personal involvement in several circular economy initiatives were also employed.},

Because of their rapid proliferation and the lack of accepted and common characteristics, the performance of these projects has been difficult to evaluate. In 2006, the former State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) of China became the first national organization to establish a national standard for eco-industrial parks. This paper aims to explore the applicability and feasibility of the selected indicators. First, it presents the details of this new standard. Second, the feasibility of the new standard is explored by applying the indicators to two industrial zones in China. The benefits and challenges faced in applying the indicators are then discussed in relation to the literature. The analysis demonstrates that the new indicators have a fairly narrow focus on eco-efficiency, rather than a broad objective of ecologically sustainable industrial development. Nevertheless, the Chinese standard is a useful beginning. In future, the authors suggest that this set of indicators be revised to add ecological dimensions that will help promote more sustainable development of industrial parks.},

However, integrating environmental and economic aims has proved difficult, despite arguments that sustainability enables ‘win‐win‐win’ solutions. Eco‐industrial development is a recent policy initiative that attempts to integrate economic, social and environmental aims in a concrete form. Derived from concepts of industrial ecology, eco‐industrial developments seek to increase business competitiveness, reduce waste and pollution, create jobs, and improve working conditions. While these initiatives are said to offer a new basis for local and regional development, there has been little critical evaluation of eco‐industrial development.},

Most EIPs are at a very early stage of development, where linkages are potential rather than real. The problems encountered in developing EIPs from scratch suggests that a more fruitful approach is to build upon existing and potential linkages within a locality, assisted by a pro-active policy to encourage interchanges.},

Research shows that many information and communication technology (ICT) tools for industrial symbiosis development have been created, but the results of those efforts are unclear. Drawing from advancements in knowledge-based economics and management, this article applies a knowledge-based framework to evaluate opportunities for ICT within industrial symbiosis development. ICT systems designed to enable industrial symbiosis are surveyed and evaluated within the proposed framework to identify strengths, trends, and opportunities for continued development.

	abstract = {The Kwinana Industrial Area of Western Australia has emerged as a world leading example of industrial symbiosis. This involves businesses in close proximity exchanging by-product material, water and energy. Utilisation of a previously discarded resource as an alternative input to another company can help improve both business and sustainability performance of the participating companies. For example, the exchange can reduce disposal costs and provide a cheaper input for the receiving company. The environmental benefits can include reduced collective resource consumption and waste generation, whilst the social benefits may include new employment opportunities and reduction of emission (e.g. water or traffic) to the local community.
This article presents the integrated research programme undertaken at the Centre of Excellence in Cleaner Production, Curtin University of Technology which seeks to enhance the uptake of industrial symbiosis in Australian heavy industrial areas. The case of Kwinana is discussed with illustrative case studies of industrial symbiosis exchanges. International interest in the creation of industrial symbiosis continues to grow and the article concludes with a discussion on the emerging role of measurement and control technolo},

	abstract = {This article is one effort to examine the present and potential performances of CO2 emission reduction though industrial symbiosis by employing a case study approach and life cycle CO2 analysis for alternative industrial symbiosis scenarios. As one of the first and the best-known eco-town projects, Kawasaki Eco-town was chosen as a case study area. First, the current industrial symbiosis practices in this area are introduced. To evaluate the potential of reducing the total CO2 emission through industrial symbiosis, alternative industrial symbiosis scenarios are then designed based on a questionnaire survey of 57 major local industries, to which 35 companies appropriately responded. The main focus of this paper is to calculate the total CO2 emission for different scenarios by adopting a life cycle CO2 analysis method. We then present recommendations on further improvement with consideration of the local realities. Our findings are that industrial symbiosis practices in Kawasaki Eco-town still have room for improvement in that greenhouse gas emissions can be further reduced and natural resources conserved through effective material exchanges, not only between companies, but also with the surrounding area. To encourage material exchanges between the municipality and industry, the city government should introduce a detailed separation program for garbage collection so that wastes can be effectively reused. In addition, the Waste Disposal and Public Cleaning Law needs amending so that industries can effectively use municipal solid waste in their manufacturing.},

The most often referenced eco-industrial park found in Kalundborg, Denmark, serves as an ideal, and is typified by tight interdependency between industrial partners, green logistics, and closed-loop supply chains. But the planet is in crisis [Atiyah and Press, joint statement from The Royal Society and the Hational Academy of Sciences on Population Growth and Sustainability, February 1992 ] and cannot afford to wait 30 years for more of these parks to emerge. Systems engineering has been found to be effective when bringing together stakeholders from diverse backgrounds and experts from multidisciplinary engineering and technical backgrounds to coordinate the creation of complex systems.

This article includes data from six of these EIP development projects. Three of the projects discussed are located in the Netherlands and three in the US. This article compares the differences in project approach and results on a national level. The approach suggested is derived from the available EIP development literature.

Initial research indicates that the Dutch EIP projects are more successful than their US counterparts. This difference in success can be, mostly, attributed to the fact that the US projects are initiated by local and regional governments that see the project as a way to improve the local/regional economy with access to substantial government funds. Because of this heavy government involvement, US companies are, in general, not interested in the project. The more successful Dutch projects, on the other hand, are mostly initiated by the companies themselves with financial and advisory support from the local and regional government.},

The approach is based on an analogy between certain objects studied by the science of ecology (ecosystems, metabolisms, symbiosis, biocenosis, etc.) and industrial systems. However, this analogical relationship raises difficulties due to the various interpretations to which it is open. Although there is agreement regarding its heuristic function, the analogy can nevertheless be understood either as a model or as a metaphor. The present article first attempts to show how models differ from metaphors. It then sets out to justify the epistemological relevance of this distinction for industrial ecology research. The reflection should thus contribute to clarifying the debate on the (supposed or desired) role of analogy in the field of industrial ecology and heighten the interest this field of investigation represents for implementing sustainable development.},

Christensen formerly championed industrial symbiosis in Kalundborg, Denmark, and Lowitt shepherded the process at the Londonderry EIP in New Hampshire, USA. Based on the empirical data collected from the methods of ethnography and grounded theory, a systematic analysis of champion behaviour revealed emergent themes that champions of EIPs emphasize social relationships as opposed to technological connections. The repeating themes of trust and community embeddedness, proximity and the importance of the champion to the long-term viability of the project were highlighted.

	abstract = {Tackling fuel poverty is central to the delivery of the Scottish Executive’s commitment to social justice. Many Scottish rural households are not linked into the mains gas network and rely on expensive alternatives, despite being surrounded by plentiful supplies of low-cost renewable wood biomass. A regional study was undertaken to establish the potential market for pelletised wood fuel, available as a low-value by-product from the rapidly expanding Scottish forest industry sector. The wider implications of the research findings are analysed by extending the principles of industrial symbiosis from a site-specific to a regional scale. Promoting an indigenous pellet-based wood fuel market for rural Scotland would fulfil important Scottish Executive economic, social and environmental sustainability objectives. Adding off-site social symbiotic elements increases the potential for on-site technical symbiosis in nascent Scottish forest industry clusters. At present, market failure is preventing the realisation of these benefits, and the paper concludes by identifying ways in which market intermediation, through wood fuel energy service companies, might overcome the current barriers to exploiting such symbiosis.},

	abstract = {Industrial ecology represents an emerging interdisciplinary field of studying industrial systems in combination with their fundamental linkage with nature. An eye-catching characteristic at the basis of industrial ecology's scientific profile is its refreshingly unorthodox perspective of understanding nature as model, compared with other disciplines of understanding nature, e.g. in terms of ‘sack of resources’ or ‘biophysical limit’ as opposed to industrial systems. The idea of industrial ecology's appealing perspective is to balance the development of industrial systems with the constraints of natural ecosystems, analogous to an ‘industrial symbiosis’. On the basis of initial efforts to conceptualize industrial ecology's underlying assumptions concerning nature, a philosophically focused approach of its characteristic perspective of understanding nature as model is presented. The contribution may provide industrial ecologists as well as other economists, engineers, scientists and policy-makers involved in the field of sustainability with an opportunity for accessible philosophical reflection, perhaps bringing to the surface their tacit frames regarding nature. Consequently, the goal is to gain greater conceptual clarity and to contribute to laying a solid foundation for industrial ecology's stimulating role when initiating change towards sustainability at large.

The industrial symbiosis complex in Kalundborg, Denmark is the seminal example of industrial symbiosis in the industrial ecology literature. In spite of this, there has been no in-depth quantitative analysis enabling more comprehensive understanding of economic and environmental performances connected to this case. In this article some of the central industrial symbiotic exchanges, involving water and steam, in Kalundborg are analyzed, using detailed economic and environmental data. It is found that both substantial and minor environmental benefits accrue from these industrial symbiosis exchanges and that economic motivation often is connected to upstream or downstream operational performance and not directly associated with the value of the exchanged byproduct or waste itself. It is concluded that industrial symbiosis, as viewed from a company perspective, has to be understood both in terms of individual economic and environmental performance, and as a more collective approach to industrial sustainability.},

	abstract = {By ‘working with the willing’, the National Industrial Symbiosis Programme (NISP) has successfully facilitated industrial symbiosis throughout the United Kingdom and, in the process, delivered significant economic and environmental benefits for both Programme members and the country as a whole. One of the keys to NISP's success is that, unlike failed attempts to plan and construct eco-industrial systems from scratch, the Programme works largely with existing companies who have already settled in, developed, and successfully operate within a given locale. This article argues that existing and mature industrial systems provide the best prospects for identifying opportunities for, and ultimately facilitating, industrial symbiosis. Due to levels of diversification and operational fundamental niches that, in the fullness of time, develop within all industrial systems, industrially mature areas are deemed to be industrial symbiosis ‘conducive environments’. Building on the conservation biology concept of a habitat suitability index, the article presents a methodology for comparing a potential site for eco-industrial development to a known baseline industrial ‘habitat’ already identified as being highly conducive to industrial symbiosis. The suitability index methodology is further developed and applied to a multi-criteria evaluation geographic information system to produce a ‘habitat’ suitability map that allows practitioners to quickly identify potential industrial symbiosis hotspots (the methodology is illustrated for England). The article concludes by providing options for the development of symbiosis suitability indices and how they can be used to support the facilitation of industrial symbiosis and regional resource efficiency.},

The results of this study showed that there are financial benefits to industrial symbiosis compared to the same system operated in stand-alone mode, and that the industrial symbiosis configuration generates a more stable system. However, it is difficult to generalize the results from a case study, and the main conclusion drawn is that it is possible to show that industrial symbiosis has economical benefits, although the magnitude of these benefits needs to be evaluated from case to case.},

Considering the autonomy of network entities and their actions, we apply agent-based simulation to analyze how the network actually evolves. These two perspectives are integrated into a powerful multiscale modeling framework for evaluating the consequences of new policy instruments or different business strategies aimed at stimulating sustainable development as well as identifying optimal leverage points for improved performance of the network in question.

This paper reviews the stakeholders' understanding of EIPs. Furthermore, research was conducted on the barriers to the actual promotion of the project in South Korea. First, stakeholders' understanding of EIPs is identified as being self-interested. The need for EIPs is mostly found in responding to civil complaints and pollutants resulting from the industrial park. However, the need is quite different from the original intention of EIPs. As a result, the project unsuccessfully deals with the needs of the stakeholders because of technical, economic, and social obstacles. Second, support from the public sector for the project seems quite inadequate. The public sector appears to lack the proper policy means and will to actualize the project.

	abstract = {Most chemical companies consume a lot of steam, water and electrical resources in the production process. Given recent record fuel costs, utility networks must be optimized to reduce the overall cost of production. Environmental concerns must also be considered when preparing modifications to satisfy the requirements for industrial utilities, since wastes discharged from the utility networks are restricted by environmental regulations. Construction of Eco-Industrial Parks (EIPs) has drawn attention as a promising approach for retrofitting existing industrial parks to improve energy efficiency. The optimization of the utility network within an industrial complex is one of the most important undertakings to minimize energy consumption and waste loads in the EIP.

In this work, a systematic approach to optimize the utility network of an industrial complex is presented. An important issue in the optimization of a utility network is the desire of the companies to achieve high profits while complying with the environmental regulations. Therefore, the proposed optimization was performed with consideration of both economic and environmental factors.

The proposed approach consists of unit modeling using thermodynamic principles, mass and energy balances, development of a multi-period Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model for the integration of utility systems in an industrial complex, and an economic/environmental analysis of the results. This approach is applied to the Yeosu Industrial Complex, considering seasonal utility demands. The results show that both the total utility cost and waste load are reduced by optimizing the utility network of an industrial complex.},

Understanding the evolution of industrial systems over time toward sustainable or unsustainable ways of operating is important for learning about environmental performance analyses as well as for future planning of policy and management. The evolution over time of the Uimaharju forest industry park in Eastern Finland is studied. First, the system development is described by identifying the number of IE-type ‘roundput’ material and energy flows denoting waste utilisation and sustainable use of renewables. Second, development of the system over time is shown in terms of the number of the actors involved. This structural characteristic is termed system ‘diversity’. Third, the relation of the two is considered. Fourth, the drivers of the case system development are discussed. Fifth, an initial effort is made to calculate some of the environmental effects of the system during its development. An increase in roundput and diversity over time is observed. Diversity is affecting roundput. The park tends to enlarge its activities outside the industrial park boundary over time. While the system illustrates high roundput and high diversity, we can only speculate if these characteristics contribute to sustainability, because of difficulties in system boundary definition.},

In a successful IE, a business-environment win-win might be possible because the raw material and energy costs, waste management costs, costs resulting from environmental legislation, as well as the image costs of the companies in the system and of the system as a whole, can be reduced. In this paper, the IE analogy includes the four basic principles of system development of ecosystems; roundput, diversity, locality and gradual change.

	abstract = {In several industrialised countries, there have occurred initiatives to establish eco-industrial parks. Originally, these were mainly based upon the exchange of resources between heavy industries in industrial complexes. These initiatives are generally referred to with the concepts of industrial symbiosis and eco-industrial parks. Since then, the concept of eco-industrial parks has been extended to another relevant type of industrial park, the so-called mixed industrial park, which consists of various small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), sometimes complemented by a small number of larger industries. Because of the resulting growing ambiguity in the significance of eco-industrial park initiatives, a typology is desirable for entangling the confusion that is introduced. It is argued that mixed industrial parks are poorly investigated although they have a major environmental and spatial impact. Starting from a general consideration of eco-industrial park initiatives, this paper describes the societal and environmental problems that are related to the mixed industrial parks, proposes solutions and discusses the counteracting factors. While our argument relates strongly to the traditionally industrialised countries, it is also relevant to newly industrialised countries, as they are faced with similar problems, or will encounter them in the near future.},

	abstract = {Industrial symbioses (ISs) and eco-industrial parks (EIPs) are key concepts of industrial ecology (IE). The aim of ISs and EIPs is to minimise inefficient material and energy use by utilising local by-product and energy flows. Industrial symbioses tend to develop through spontaneous action of economic actors, for gaining of economic benefit, but these systems can be designed and promoted via policy instruments as well. A literature review showed that national programmes for eco-industrial parks can be found in different parts of the world. In the action programmes and other sustainable consumption and production (SCP) policy documents of the EU, on the other hand, industrial symbioses gain less recognition as a path to enhanced sustainable production. In this article, we consider this and also analyse how the evolution and environmental performance of an industrial symbiosis system centred on a Finnish pulp and paper mill have been affected by SCP policy instruments. With regard to the system forming the subject of the case study, and Finnish industrial systems in general, policy instruments have succeeded in reducing emissions but not in systematically encouraging operators toward symbiosis-like activities. All in all, few studies exist on the overall impact of policy instruments promoting design of eco-industrial parks. It is not self-evident that symbiosis-like production systems would be sustainable in every case, as the background assumptions for political promotion of EIPs suggest. We concluded that industrial symbioses should be analysed and developed on a life cycle basis, with documentation of the real environmental benefits due to efficient resource use and decreased emissions in comparison to standalone production. ISs can then bring eco-competitiveness to companies in relation to SCP tools, such as environmental permits, ecolabels, and future product regulation based on the Ecodesign Directive in Europe. Indirect encouragement of symbiosis through land-use regulation and planning, in such a way that material fluxes between companies are possible both in operations and in financial terms, may prove effective. The same holds for waste policies that encourage increased reuse of a company’s waste by other enterprises.},

An EIPWNS is synthesized, designed, and compared to a conventional water system (CWS). The feasibility study using life cycle assessment and life cycle costing shows that the total environmental impacts of the EIPWNS are 7.5\% to 16.0\% less than those of the CWS, and the life cycle cost of the EIPWNS is 15.6\% less. Therefore, the EIPWNS can be employed in remodeling a conventional industrial park to an eco-industrial park. This study provides a good example for disseminating EIPWNSs.},

	abstract = {Recovering energy from wastes is a useful strategy for integrated waste and energy management in an eco-industrial park (EIP) and gives promising reduction of wastes, total energy consumption and operation cost. In Jinqiao EIP, Pudong New Area, Shanghai, an industrial symbiosis, based on the energy recovery from municipal sewage sludge and re-refined oil, was proposed in the central heat-supplying company of Jinqiao EIP. It is expected that hot off-gas or part of the steam from the central heat-supplying company could be used for sludge drying and used oil re-refining while the dried sludge and refined oil can be partial substitution for fossil fuel. For the purpose of assessing the environmental performance of this industrial symbiosis, life cycle assessment (LCA) was used and different scenarios were set up in this study to evaluate the Global warming Potential (GWP), Acidification Potential (AP), Eutrophication Potential (EP), Human toxicity air (HTA) and Total Environmental Impact Potential (TEIP) of the system. Results indicate that when the substitute ratio of coal by sludge is 14\%, the proposed industrial symbiosis has the least environmental impact. Compared with the current situation (sludge is landfilled), co-combustion of dried sludge and re-refined oil with coal at optimal scale will release less CO2, CH4, NOx, N2O and CO, but more SO2, H2S, NH3, HCl, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) and heavy metals.},

Following this analogy, the conceptual model of an eco-industrial park, which is an organised form of the industrial ecosystem, was presented in this paper. The model comprises of (1) the structure of the ecosystem, (2) the classification of the enterprises as producers, consumers and decomposers, (3) mass and energy flows and (4) types of interactions. The classification of the enterprises introduced here as well as the analysis of mass and energy flows indicates that the diversity of the enterprises in eco-industrial parks is desired. Furthermore, the minimal condition to create the symbiotic relationships between the enterprises is established, claiming that at least one industrial producer or decomposer must be involved in the eco-industrial park. The application of this model will facilitate the design and development of eco-industrial parks and enable the identification of symbiotic relationships between the entities of such a park and other types of industrial ecosystems. In order to show the applicability of the proposed model and its potential for the practical implementation two case studies are presented.},

The definition reflected the state of research and practice at the time; as both have advanced, some terms have been interpreted in substantially different ways. In this article we analyze those generally used terms for their connection to the ecological metaphor that is the root of industrial ecology, and their varied interpretations in IS research and practice over time. We then propose an updated definition intended to communicate the essence of IS as a tool for innovative green growth: IS engages diverse organizations in a network to foster eco-innovation and long-term culture change. Creating and sharing knowledge through the network yields mutually profitable transactions for novel sourcing of required inputs and value-added destinations for non-product outputs, as well as improved business and technical processes. We posit that, although geographic proximity is often associated with IS, it is neither necessary nor sufficient—nor is a singular focus on physical resource exchange.},

Focus is given to the management of water among multiple processes in a common EIP facility. Recycle, reuse, and separation using interception devices are considered as possible strategies for managing wastewater. A source-interception-sink structural representation is used to embed potential configurations of interest. The representation accounts for the possibilities of direct recycle, material (waste) exchange, mixing and segregation of different streams, separation and treatment in interception units, and allocation to process users (sinks). Then, the EIP design problem is formulated as an optimization program whose objective is to minimize cost of the EIP while determining optimal recycle and separation strategies. A case study is solved to illustrate the applicability of the devised approach. © 2009 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 2009},

This paper provides an approach to quantify the environmental performance of industrial symbiosis networks using guidance from the literature of life cycle assessment. Additionally, an approach to distribute credits due to exchanges for firms in the industrial symbiosis network is outlined. From the approach, influential methodological considerations used for the quantifications are discussed, including e.g. the production of reference systems, allocation methods, system boundaries and functional unit. The implications of such an approach may be beneficial for the industrial symbiosis community and provide information crucial for taxes, subsidies, business relations, expansion possibilities for the network, marketing and other issues related to the environmental performance of firms in the industrial symbiosis network.},

	abstract = {In view of recent studies of the historical development and current status of industrial symbiosis (IS), life cycle assessment (LCA) is proposed as a general framework for quantifying the environmental performance of by-product exchange. Recent guidelines for LCA (International Reference Life Cycle Data System [ILCD] guidelines) are applied to answer the main research questions in the IS literature reviewed. A typology of five main research questions is proposed: (1) analysis, (2) improvement, and (3) expansion of existing systems; (4) design of new eco-industrial parks, and (5) restructuring of circular economies. The LCA guidelines were found useful in framing the question and choosing an appropriate reference case for comparison. The selection of a correct reference case reduces the risk of overestimating the benefits of by-product exchange. In the analysis of existing systems, environmentally extended input-output analysis (EEIOA) can be used to streamline the analysis and provide an industry average baseline for comparison. However, when large-scale changes are applied to the system, more sophisticated tools are necessary for assessment of the consequences, from market analysis to general equilibrium modeling and future scenario work. Such a rigorous application of systems analysis was not found in the current IS literature, but would benefit the field substantially, especially when the environmental impact of large-scale economic changes is analyzed.},

	abstract = {Industrial symbiosis, representing resource sharing and byproduct use among colocated firms, is a key concept of industrial ecology. Local co-operation in industrial symbioses can reduce raw material use and waste disposal, but material and energy flows extending outside symbiosis boundaries can cause considerable environmental impacts. These external impacts are often ignored in industrial symbiosis studies. In this study, we compared process, hybrid and input−output life cycle assessment (LCA) approaches in quantifying the overall environmental impacts of a forest industrial symbiosis, situated in Kymenlaakso, Finland. Conclusions from an earlier process-LCA were strengthened by the use of hybrid-LCA as local emissions were found to cause less than half of the global impacts. In some impact categories, the whole impact was caused by supply chain emissions (land use, metal depletion and ozone depletion). The cutoff in process-LCA was found to be less than 25\%, except in metal depletion and terrestrial ecotoxicity. Input−output LCA approximated hybrid-LCA results well in most impact categories, but seriously underestimated land use and overestimated terrestrial ecotoxicity. Based on the results we conclude, that input−output based LCA can be used to analyze the global impacts of an industrial symbiosis, but a careful interpretation of the results is necessary in order to understand the influence of aggregation and allocation.},

These are analysed within the context of experiences gained in the early stages of three regional IS programmes under development in the UK, and of the recently launched national IS programme (NISP) that they are part of. It is stated that the policy framework in the UK has elements supportive of such networks to evolve, and the regional public bodies are favouring their development. Based on differences among studied cases, it is argued that the nature of companies’ operations and industrial history in the regions, the extent of peer pressure, the positioning of the coordinating body in the region, and its approach to awareness raising and recruitment have major influence on the progress of the programmes. Finally, the paper emphasises the importance of aligning the characteristics of emerging operations with the longer-term sustainability requirements. If accepted, this challenge assigns additional responsibilities to the coordinating parties.},

One of the applications used is to transform the industrial system linear ‘throughput’ material and energy flow that relies on imported non-renewables, on virgin renewables and produces wastes and emissions dumped to nature toward a cyclical and cascading ‘roundput’ flow that relies on local/regional renewables and wastes. The paper constructs a key function or an anchor activity that integrates the throughput material and energy flows and changes them into the roundput model in a local/regional agricultural and food industry system in Finland. This key activity is able to simultaneously utilise and process waste flows from the main steps in the food products' life cycle (value chain) and produce energy and fertiliser to the different processes in the life cycle by using waste as a fuel and as a resource with value. Difficulties in achieving this vision in practice are discussed. The paper uses national data from Finland, regional data from the Satakunta region in southwest Finland and local data from the municipality of Huittinen in Satakunta. A methodology in which environmental, economic and social variables are studied with different ‘what if?’ scenarios for the roundput model and for the throughput model is presented.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an industrial ecological insight into local waste management in Pielinen Karelia, Finland. There local system is experiencing major changes because of tightening EC waste legislation including the directives on waste incineration (2000/76/EC) and landfilling of wastes (1999/31/EC). Small local landfills are closing and most of municipal wastes will be transported 120–180 km to large-scale waste management centre in Kuopio. The paper applies three industrial ecosystem indicators, based on environmental, economic and employment impacts of different waste management technologies. Environmental indicator is CO2 equivalent emission, economic indicator is based on costs and revenues of waste management, and social (i.e. employment) indicator includes new jobs generated. The results indicate that waste incineration option in forthcoming regional cooperation could create emission savings up to 117–394 kg CO2 eqv./ton of municipal waste when compared to local landfilling. As economic impacts, new regional cooperation and long-distance transportations will increase the costs from previous 45.6–55.2 €/ton in local landfilling to 97.4 €/ton in regional landfilling and 120.8–126.9 €/ton in regional REF-III incineration. In terms of employment, the new cooperation could create 2–6.5 new jobs. The regional cooperation results to rising operational costs but avoids investments to new local infrastructure. It also creates significant emission savings, maintains current employment in waste handling and creates new jobs in long-distance transportation.},

However, assessing the Brazilian traditional alcohol production cycle, many social and environmental impacts may still be indicated: burning, pesticides, biodiversity, labor exploration, high water consumption, erosion and others. Based on the strategy of an agro-industrial networking and symbiosis, a project was designed to optimize the system by means of polygeneration and total integration of production steps. The case presented in this paper is the project for a social and ecological agro-industry model, named GERIPA (Geração de Energia Renovável Integrada à Produção de Alimentos), which produces renewable fuel, electricity and organic food. Besides the technical project, an economic evaluation is also presented, resulting into a five year pay back time. In addition, environmental and social aspects were evaluated by means the Emergy Synthesis methodology (Odum, 1996), which assesses the value of all inputs through an estimate of the environmental work directly and indirectly required for their production and sustainable supply. The emergy-based comparison of GERIPA system and a traditional system in Brazil indicates better performance of GERIPA, with an eMergy Sustainability Index of 1.26, much higher than for a traditional system, 0.22. The project is presently under discussion with investors and Government and, if approved, will be carried out in marginal and presently unused land. In addition to providing an environmentally friendly process for food and energy production, the project would generate new jobs opportunities for Brazilian rural workers presently unemployed.},

This article studies the evolution of an IS centred around a Finnish pulp and paper mill and analyses how the operations of the case system developed in a more sustainable direction during the years 1890–2005. We build upon basic sustainability principles known as The Natural Step (TNS) System Conditions by identifying and selecting quantifiable indicators for each of the conditions in the case of our target symbiosis. The study reveals that the environmental impacts of the case IS became more far-reaching during the 110-year period studied. Emissions, however, decreased substantially after the 1970s due to tightening environmental legislation and other policy measures and the progress in environmental technology, not due to symbiosis-type of arrangements. There has been no strong driver for more symbiosis-like cooperation among the companies in this study. It appeared that the main motives for increased collaboration were economic.},

In particular, we analyze shifts in the network orchestrator's actions and the network's structure and composition. We find that an orchestrator builds the capacity to assemble a network over time through the accumulation of resources and specialized expertise. However, as the network develops, an orchestrator faces an evolving set of dilemmas arising from the need to demonstrate value for various members and audiences. To resolve these dilemmas, orchestrators may shift their actions, moving from initially encouraging serendipitous encounters between network members (“blind dates”) to increasingly selecting members and more closely influencing their interactions (“arranging marriages”). We discuss implications of our findings for a processual understanding of orchestrated network assembly and growth.},

	abstract = {In order to stabilize the global climate, the world's governments must make significant commitments to drastically reduce global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. One of the most promising methods of curbing GHG emissions is a world transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy. Solar photovoltaic (PV) cells offer a technically sustainable solution to the projected enormous future energy demands. This article explores utilizing industrial symbiosis to obtain economies of scale and increased manufacturing efficiencies for solar PV cells in order for solar electricity to compete economically with fossil fuel-fired electricity. The state of PV manufacturing, the market and the effects of scale on both are reviewed. Government policies necessary to construct a multi-gigaWatt PV factory and complementary policies to protect existing solar companies are outlined and the technical requirements for a symbiotic industrial system are explored to increase the manufacturing efficiency while improving the environmental impact of PV. The results of the analysis show that an eight-factory industrial symbiotic system can be viewed as a medium-term investment by any government, which will not only obtain direct financial return, but also an improved global environment. The technical concepts and policy limitations to this approach were analyzed and it was found that symbiotic growth will help to mitigate many of the limitations of PV and is likely to catalyze mass manufacturing of PV by transparently demonstrating that large-scale PV manufacturing is technically feasible and reaches an enormous untapped market for PV with low costs.},

	abstract = {The UK Sustainable Development Strategy requires that society strive to make prudent use of natural resources so as to protect the environment and maintain high and stable levels of economic growth and employment. The Waste Strategy for England and Wales emphasises the need to reduce the amount of waste produced through the adoption of waste minimisation methodology. Waste minimisation clubs have been a key element in the UK programme to introduce more sustainable practice into industry and commerce. Northamptonshire, a county in the East Midlands of England, has benefited from 20 waste minimisation/resource efficiency projects, within a county programme, that have run between 1997 and 2004. This is the largest number in any county in England. This has been possible because of the formation of a large and inclusive partnership that contains all the key Local and Regional players. Performance Indicators have been developed to direct the county programme as it strives to introduce more sustainable waste management practice. The Northamptonshire model has led to a catalysed uptake of sustainable waste management practice in some 574 companies, some 13.4\% of participating companies in England in same period, thereby contributing to the maintenance of stable levels of economic activity. However, an inherent limit has been reached with waste minimisation club provision. Future provision for resource efficiency must include the movement towards Industrial Symbiosis (IS) and ultimately Industrial Ecology (IE). The radical shift towards IS and IE will occur as a response to the increased quantification of the resource flows, in a given UK economic area, and the deeper understanding of the diversity and complexity of the systems.},

	abstract = {Closing loops by intercompany recycling of by-products is a core theme of industrial ecology (IE). This article considers whether industrial recycling networks or industrial symbiosis projects can be used as a starting point for much broader intercompany cooperation for sustainable development. Evidence presented is based on the results of an empirical investigation of the recycling network Styria in Austria, the recycling network Oldenburger Münsterland in Germany, and the manufacturing sector in Austria. Statistical analysis shows that the percentage of by-products that are passed on to other companies for recycling purposes is not higher in member companies of the recycling networks than in the other companies of the manufacturing sector in Austria. In terms of cooperation, the relationships with the respective recycling partners are found to be very similar to regular customer relations. Furthermore, the companies of the recycling networks remain unaware of the network to which they belong. Instead, one of the main findings of this study is that intercompany recycling activities are regarded by the company representatives as bilateral market transactions, not as collaborative network activities. This has potentially significant implications for the use of industrial symbiosis networks as starting points for sustainability networks with broader cooperation toward sustainability. The findings raise interesting questions as to whether such broader cooperation might result from a conscious planning process or might emerge largely spontaneously as part of normal market coordination. In any case, intercompany recycling is clearly considered to be a very important field of collaborative action for sustainability in industry.},

This paper uses research undertaken to investigate the application of industrial ecology to ensure more sustainable industry development in the State of Queensland, Australia, to develop a set of principles and planning guidelines for use by governments to facilitate the development of eco-industrial parks.

The model integrates the waste streams of mining industries in the Kola Peninsula in such a way that waste from one industrial operator becomes raw material for another. Using a counterfactual method, this article determines the eco-efficiency of the model between the years 1985 and 2005. A parallel study of the eco-efficiency of the actual system, i.e. in the absence of complex utilization, is then performed for the same time period. The study shows that complex utilization would indeed have yielded increased eco-efficiency, even though not all environmentally harmful emissions would have decreased. As a result of market collapse and the use of upstream pollution prevention together with traditional end-of-pipe technologies, however, the actual system shows net emission reductions similar to those modeled in complex utilization. It is suggested that in systems like the mining industry of the Kola Peninsula, with high production volumes and poorly developed environmental technologies, upstream pollution prevention together with traditional end-of-pipe technologies may prove more attractive than industrial symbiosis, despite the substantial increases in eco-efficiency of the latter.},

The methodology is applied to a case study of an industrial area located in Catalonia (Spain). Despite the heterogeneity of the area, by using simple data the indicators detect companies with high consumption or inefficiency. These companies have many opportunities to improve on these aspects and the indicators can measure and reflect their evolution. In addition, the results show the importance that some flows such as water inputs (1.5 times higher than material inputs) and indirect flows associated with imports, which often are omitted, can have in some study cases.},

This article provides a case study of the Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area (TEDA). The emergence of an environmental institution in TEDA is used as a backdrop to assess how TEDA has transformed itself into one of the top three national eco-industrial parks in China. Following two years of field research, a network of 81 inter-firm symbiotic relationships formed in TEDA during the past 16 years were identified involving the utility, automobile, electronics, biotechnology, food and beverage, and resource recovery clusters. The article assesses the environmental benefits of the key symbiotic exchanges in TEDA and summarizes some unique characteristics of EIP progress in a developing country.},

	abstract = {Industrial ecosystem is an important approach for sustainable development. In an industrial ecosystem, a group of industries are inter-connected through mass and energy exchanges for mutual benefits. However, some mass and energy exchange activities may cause unexpected environmental impacts. Therefore, it is vital to evaluate the environmental impacts of the symbiosis in order to provide a clear guidance for the decision-makers and stakeholders.

The agro-chemical complex in the Lower Mississippi River Corridor with thirteen chemical and petrochemical industries emits huge amount of carbon dioxide. A bi-level design methodology is used to reconfigure this complex for utilizing surplus carbon dioxide. By using a superstructure-based approach, a new design scheme for this industrial ecosystem is proposed. In this paper, an LCA-type environmental impact assessment of different design schemes for this complex is conducted using the software TRACI, a tool developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). This analysis compares various environmental impacts of different designs and identifies the potential trade-offs in different environmental impact categories. This information provides deep insight about the environmental sustainability of industrial ecosystems and facilitates the development of the most eco-effective symbiosis for recycle, reuse and resource conservation.},

	abstract = {The emerging concept of industrial ecology (IE) has been applied in practice in few case studies on local/regional industrial recycling networks. Analogously to a natural ecosystem, the aim is to develop material cycles and energy cascades between local cooperative actors. An optimal resource basis of an industrial ecosystem is the sustainable use of local renewable natural resources. In this paper, we consider the region of North Karelia in Finland, with 19 municipalities, and hence somewhat expand the system boundaries of an industrial ecosystem case study. The current situation and two scenarios of municipal heating energy production are presented. The heating system consists of individual, district and electric heating. The heat production and related greenhouse gas emissions are considered. The current fuel use is based on imported oil and regional fuels (peat, wood wastes). Also, shares for co-production of heat and electricity (CHP) are shown. In scenario one, we assume the majority of the fuel basis in oil and absence of CHP. Scenario two illustrates nearly complete dependence on regional wood wastes and firewood with the current share of CHP. The North Karelia region provides the IE theory with a fruitful case study because the supply of waste fuels and local renewables is vast and waste utilisation technologies (CHP, fluidized bed burning) constitute a significant part of energy production. Implications of the applied scenario approach are discussed in the context of regional decision making and, in particular, for its implementation with the concepts of a regional environmental management system (EMS) and a regional industrial ecosystem management system (RIEMS).},

Thermoeconomics has two key advantages as analysis method for Industrial Symbiosis: it provides a systemic and rigorous framework and, due to the use of exergy for flow quantification, streams of different nature are measured in the same unit.

The goal of the paper is to analyze in depth the process of exergy cost formation of flows within a system, which change when it is integrated with other systems, by using two complimentary approaches. First, a strategy based on irreversibility of the different components and effects of waste internalization already developed is applied for the first time to an example of Industrial Symbiosis. Second, a new method tracing the origin of the different resources consumed by the system is developed. This approach is very interesting for Industrial Symbiosis examples, characterized by a diversity of resources.

A system composed of a coal-fired power plant, a cement kiln and a gas-fired boiler operating in isolated and integrated fashion is analyzed by using both presented approaches.},

Thermoeconomics is based on the exergy analysis (Thermodynamics) but goes further by introducing the concepts of purpose and cost (Economics). It is presented in this study as a systematic and general approach for the analysis of waste flow integration. The formulation is based on extending the thermoeconomic process of the cost formation of wastes in order to consider their use as input for other processes. Consequently, it can be applied to important Industrial Ecology issues such as identification of integration possibilities and efficiency improvement, quantification of benefits obtained by integration, or determination of fair prices based on physical roots. The capability of the methodology is demonstrated by means of a case study based on the integration of a power plant, a cement kiln and a gas-fired boiler.},

	abstract = {The development of regional resource synergies in heavy industrial areas provides a significant avenue towards sustainable resource processing. Despite the fact that the number of examples of regional resource synergies around the world is growing, the reuse of inorganic by-products (e.g. bauxite residue, fly ash, kiln dusts, gypsum, slag) in Australia have not yet materialised on a significant scale. This is due to the fragmented approach adopted in the past and a range of barriers associated with their reuse. The drivers and barriers for inorganic by-product reuses appear to fall in nine broad categories: regulation, economics, community, technology, transportation, confidential and commercial issues, risk and liabilities, industry focus and priorities, and region specific issues. This paper shows that significant potential exist for the establishment of large volume reuse of these inorganic by-products in Australia, using the Kwinana Industrial Area as a case study. The inorganic by-products available in Kwinana could be used to supply the growing demand for already scarce building and construction materials in Western Australia. Although regulatory reuse standards exist elsewhere (e.g. European Union, USA), one of the main obstacles for the Kwinana industries is the absence of standard application protocols to allow for the routine use of their inorganic by-products. A coordinated stakeholder approach is being facilitated and applied in Kwinana that targets the realisation of large volume reuse opportunities that have both a good business and sustainability case and also government and community support. Based on the Kwinana experiences, this paper provides perspectives and learnings for elsewhere in Australia and in countries where current regulatory frameworks do not encourage or restrict the uptake of inorganic by-product reuses on a large scale.},

	abstract = {The realization of regional synergies in industrial areas with intensive minerals processing provides a significant avenue toward sustainable resource processing. This article provides an overview of past and current synergy developments in two of Australia's major heavy industrial regions, Kwinana (Western Australia) and Gladstone (Queensland), and includes a comparative review and assessment of the drivers, barriers, and trigger events for regional synergies initiatives in both areas. Kwinana and Gladstone compare favorably with well-known international examples in terms of the current level and maturity of industry involvement and collaboration and the commitment to further explore regional resource synergies. Kwinana stands out with regard to the number, diversity, complexity, and maturity of existing synergies. Gladstone is remarkable with regard to unusually large geographic boundaries and high dominance of one industry sector. Many diverse regional synergy opportunities still appear to exist in both industrial regions (particularly in Kwinana), mostly in three broad areas: water, energy, and inorganic by-product reuse. To enhance the further development of new regional synergies, the Centre for Sustainable Resource Processing (CSRP), a joint initiative of Australian minerals processing companies, research providers, and government agencies, has undertaken several collaborative projects. These include research to facilitate the process of identifying and evaluating potential synergy opportunities and assistance for the industries with feasibility studies and implementation of selected synergy projects in both regions. The article also reports on the progress to date from this CSRP research.},

	abstract = {Japan's Eco-Town Program spearheaded in Japan the integration of Industrial Symbiosis and Urban Symbiosis, seeking to maximise the economic and environmental benefit from close geographic proximity of industrial and urban areas, through the use of previously discarded commercial, municipal and industrial waste materials in industrial applications. The program established 26 Eco-Towns around Japan. Approximately 1.65 billion USD was invested in 61 innovative recycling projects, with an average government subsidy of 36\%. In addition at least 107 other recycling facilities have been constructed without government subsidy. 14 Eco-Towns primarily contributed to improving industry's productivity, whilst 10 Eco-Towns primarily contributed to improving environmental amenity. In 16 Eco-Towns the private sector was the most important actor supporting local government in the realisation of the Eco-Town, whilst in 9 Eco-Towns this was civil society. The availability of investment subsidies, the coming into force of ambitious recycling legislation with quantified, product-specific targets, access to the significant technological resources of the private sector, and widespread recognition of the urgency to act on environmental issues, all contributed to the success of the Eco-Town Program.},

Existing eco-industrialism is presented as flawed, with many cases premised on the use of nonrenewable resources. Renewable eco-industrial development, while still nascent, has the potential both to resolve some sustainability challenges and to offer a new area of endeavor for industrial ecology, albeit one with its own unique difficulties, such as conflict with food production. Renewable eco-industrial development is further argued to bring industrial ecology into a more socially critical stance as it concerns the future allocation of scarce resources.},

Besides its name and a number of borrowed concepts, however, industrial ecology has no formal relationship with the ecological sciences. This study explores the potential for further interdisciplinary collaboration by testing whether some of the same quantitative analysis techniques used in community ecology research can have meaning in an industrial context. Specifically, we applied the ecological concepts of connectance and diversity to an analysis of Burnside Industrial Park in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Our results demonstrate that these ecological tools show promise for use in industrial ecology. We discuss the meaning of connectance and diversity concepts in an industrial context and suggest next steps for future studies. We hope that this research will help to lay the groundwork of an ecologically inspired tool kit for analyzing industrial ecosystems.},

	abstract = {The application of ecological concepts to the industrial setting has been touched upon by literature across several disciplines. Two emerging ecological planning approaches, landscape ecology and industrial ecology, are applied here to look at alternative ways of planning industrial parks. As an emerging field, landscape ecology provides different viewpoints from the traditional approach of natural conservation, which mainly focuses on the protection of nature. The approach of landscape ecology regards the environment as a land mosaic, a mixture of natural and urban environment, which concerns a manageable human-scale environment across one or two human generations. Industrial ecology, on the other hand, goes beyond the traditional “end of pipe” idea of pollution control and learns from the ecosystem concept. The current paper is an attempt to reconcile these two fields as an integrated approach to the planning of industrial areas. Using a case study of Singapore’s Jurong Island industrial park, two fundamental issues behind the idea of landscape ecology and industrial ecology are raised. If raw materials, energy and by-products are more easily replaced or reused by technology and management, then research on industrial ecology and related knowledge will be crucial for developing natural resource substitution by innovative technology and new ways of environmental management. Where it is difficult to substitute natural resources, the skills of planning and managing natural resources will take priority over other strategies. In this situation, the knowledge of landscape ecology needs to be applied to the prediction, design and evaluation of ecologically optimum resource uses, patterns and processes in the mixture of natural, urban and industrial environment. A new concept, “nurtured landscape”, is proposed for mediating between the natural ecosystem and the urban/industrial environment. The nurtured landscape provides a basis for the development of new ecological technology using landscape to ameliorate the polluting effects of the urban/industrial neighbourhood. The planning of Singapore’s Jurong Island industrial park provides a test of applying the principles of landscape ecology and industrial ecology to the possible transformation of an industrial area.},

By constructing industrial ecosystems, Nanning Sugar Co., Ltd. in China, has achieved the successful transition from a traditional corporation to a sustainable corporation, or rather, a circular corporation. This study expounds on its whole transition course to a circular complex in the past decade, in which four factors are essential to making this symbiosis achievable: rational production structures; raw materials advantages; technical supports and correct diversification. The corporation is in charge of almost all the aspects of its affiliated companies and the management mode, in particular, differing from that of industrial symbiosis systems in Kalundborg, is considered another potential factor contributing to the corporate success. The transition mode in question is hoped to point to a feasible development path for similar corporations.},

	abstract = {Industrial symbiosis, a subfield of industrial ecology, focuses on transforming the waste of one firm into the valuable input of another, which improves the competitive advantages of supply chain by reducing production cost and improving environmental performance. Considering the specific situation where there are so many state-owned big company groups in China, this paper utilizes the ideas of constructing an industrial symbiosis among different firms, and does a case study on applying the concept into the inner relationships' reconstruction among different production systems in a big state-owned smeltery in South-west China. Three kinds of approaches are explored: 1) recycling and reusing the release; 2) concentrating and abstracting metals from the residues; 3) extending the product chain for value-added products. The results show that it can effectively improve the competitive advantage of the enterprise in terms of decreasing production cost and improving environmental performance.},

	abstract = {To decouple economic growth from environmental degradation, the Chinese government proposed the circular economy (CE) strategy as part of its 11th 5-Year Plan. This strategy expands the application of CE from individual enterprises to eco-industrial parks (EIPs) and to the cities, provinces, and regions. We carried out field studies in three EIPs in Baotou, Suzhou, and Shanghai. In this paper, we discuss the current state of CE and the sustainable development of EIPs in China. We first provide detailed information on the three EIPs' infrastructures, preferential policies, CE frameworks, and eco-chains. We then examine the status of sustainable development in the three EIPs from the perspectives of socio-economic, resource and material efficiency, and environmental performance. The results indicate that the overall performance of the three EIPs is reasonably good with respect to socio-economics, resources and materials, and efficiency and environmental protection, whereas green management is rather weak and thus requires further improvement. We found that the CE frameworks along with eco-chains within the EIPs are effectively improving resource and material efficiency. Moreover, we demonstrate that there are positive associations among socio-economic, resource and material, and environmental indicators. Given the large presence of EIPs in the local economies, these results suggest that EIPs play a key role in promoting sustainable development in China.},

	abstract = {Industrial symbiosis promises environmental and economic gains through a utilization of the waste of some processes as a resource for other processes. Because of the costs and difficulties of transporting some wastes, the largest theoretical potential for industrial symbiosis is given when facilities are colocated in an eco-industrial park (EIP). This study proposes a model-centered approach with an eight-step procedure for the early planning and design of an eco-industrial park considering technical and environmental factors. Chemical process simulation software was used to model the energy and material flows among the prospective members and to quantify the benefits of integration among different firms in terms of energy and resources saved as compared to a reference situation. Process simulation was based on a combination of physical models of industrial processes and empirical models. The modeling allows for the development and evaluation of different collaboration opportunities and configurations. It also enables testing chosen configurations under hypothetical situations or external conditions. We present a case study around an existing oil and gas refinery in Mongstad, Norway. We used the approach to propose the colocation of a number of industrial facilities around the refinery, focused on integrating energy use among the facilities. An EIP with six main members was designed and simulated, matching new hypothetical members in size to the existing operations, modeling material and energy flows in the EIP, and assessing these in terms of carbon and hydrogen flows.},

We simulated and evaluated a redesigned eco-industrial system in Changchun Economic and Technological Development Zone (CCETDZ) in the present work using system dynamics and grey cluster methods. Four typical development strategies were simulated during 2005–2020 via standard system dynamic models. Furthermore, analytic hierarchy process and grey cluster allowed for the eco-industrial system evaluation and scenarios optimizing. Our dynamic simulation and statistical analysis revealed that: (1) CCETDZ would have different development scenarios under different strategies. The total population in scenario 2 grew most rapidly and reached 3.28 × 105 in 2020, exceeding its long-term planning expected population. And the GDP differences among these four scenarios would amount to 6.41 × 1010 RMB. On the other hand, environmental pollution would become serious along with economy increasing. As a restriction factor, positive or negative increment of water resource will occur according to the selected strategy. (2) The fourth strategy would have the best efficiency, which means that the most efficiently development of CCETDZ required to take science, technology, environment progress and economy increase into account at the same time. (3) Positive environment protection measures, such as cleaner production, green manufacture, production life cycle management and environment friendly industries, should be attached great importance the same as economy development during 2005–2020 in CCETDZ.},

This strategy has generated new revenues and reduced environmental emissions and disposal costs, while simultaneously improving the quality of sugar. Internally, the GG's complex consists of interlinked production of sugar, alcohol, cement, compound fertilizer, and paper and includes recycling and reuse. Externally, the GG has established a strong customer base as a result of its product quality, has worked to maintain and expand its supply base through technological and economic incentives to farmers (and even to competitors), and has had to react to a strong government presence that fundamentally affects its operations. Operations to date support some of the fundamental concepts of industrial symbiosis.

	abstract = {Industrial ecosystems improve eco-efficiency at the system level through optimizing material and energy flows, which however raises a concern for system resilience because efficiency, as traditionally conceived, not necessarily promotes resilience. By drawing on the concept of resilience in ecological systems and in supply chains, resilience in industrial ecosystems is specified on the basis of a system's ability to maintain eco-efficient material and energy flows under disruptions. Using a network model that captures supply, asset, and organizational dependencies and propagation of disruptions among firms, the resilience, and particularly resistance as an important dimension of resilience, of two real industrial ecosystems and generalized specifications are examined. The results show that an industrial ecosystem is less resistant and less resilient with high inter-firm dependency, preferentially organized physical exchanges, and under disruptions targeted at highly connected firms. An industrial ecosystem with more firms and exchanges is less resistant, but has more eco-efficient flows and potentials, and therefore is less likely to lose its function of eco-efficiency. Taking these determinants for resilience into consideration improves the adaptability of an industrial ecosystem, which helps increase its resilience.},
